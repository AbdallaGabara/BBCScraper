Mr Wolf last week called on Mr Trump to \"strongly condemn\" the protesters who stormed Congress.\nThe outgoing secretary said his departure had been prompted by \"recent events\", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment.\nLaw enforcement around the country are said to be bracing for the possibility of further violence in the days before Joe Biden takes office. \nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.   \n around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. \nCalls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots.\nLocal police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses following last week's violence, according to US media. \nThe Reuters news agency, citing a federal law enforcement official, said the FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. \nAlthough the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were reported elsewhere in the country at the same time.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday that it would begin National Special Security Event (NSSE) operations for the inauguration six days early, starting Wednesday.\nThe designation allows a wide range of security and law enforcement agencies to coordinate together on special protective measures, like enforcing road closures and a secure perimeter.\nThe announcement came after Washington DC's Mayor, Ms Bowser, went public with her appeal to bolster security after what she described as an \"unprecedented terrorist attack\" at the US Capitol last week.\nShe has also asked Americans to avoid travel to Washington DC for the event. Inaugurations traditionally draw hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital, but the coronavirus pandemic had already curtailed those plans before security fears were heightened. \nThe Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, said Monday that 10,000 troops will be in Washington DC by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested by local officials.\nElsewhere, the National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid \"credible threats\" of further violence.  \n\"Groups involved in the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol continue to threaten to disrupt the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20,\" the service said in a statement, adding it could institute further temporary closures to other areas within the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \nSpeaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was \"not afraid\" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears.\nHis inauguration committee has announced that the ceremony will be themed around \"America United\". \nAfter being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. \nDonald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years not to do so.\nThe warnings about further pro-Trump violence come as efforts move forward to impeach the president for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol.\nAn article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" during a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was \"stolen\" from him. \nDemocrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office.\nMr Trump has made no public statements since \n - on Friday.\nIt comes as websites and social media networks crackdown against other users and websites seen to be encouraging violence - including social network Parler, \n.

The 76-year-old faces 10 challengers, most notably the pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine. \nHuman rights groups have accused security forces of using excessive force to break up opposition rallies during the campaign. But the government says the strong measures are necessary to ensure people comply with a ban on large crowds imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nHere are the five things you need to know about the crucial vote:\nPresident Museveni is one of the longest-serving presidents in Africa. He and his National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986 at the end of a five-year war, and have led Uganda ever since.\nHis supporters praise him for bringing relative peace and prosperity to the country, and in particular for his policies on health. He helped limit the spread of HIV, and more recently his harsh lockdown - which closed schools and business, banned vehicle movement and imposed mandatory public mask use in May - is credited with tackling the coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to Johns Hopkins University, \n and around just 300 deaths from the illness.\nBut while he was once hailed in the West as one of the new generation of African leaders, his critics accuse him of turning into another authoritarian leader. \nMr Museveni has no designated successor within his party, and in 2017 \n allowing him to run again for the presidency. \nHe has seen off a number of challengers to his rule over the years, notably long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was arrested numerous times and decided not to run again for the presidency in 2021. \nWhile Mr Museveni maintains a large support base, especially in rural areas, he is facing increasing opposition over rising inequality and his rigid control over the country.\nOne of 10 candidates challenging him for the presidency this year is musician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known by the stage name Bobi Wine. \nAffectionately referred to as the \"ghetto president\", the 38-year-old became an East African musical superstar in the early 2000s before switching to politics and winning a seat in parliament in 2017.\nBobi Wine is seen as the biggest challenge to Mr Museveni's rule and has mobilised many young people who have not previously been involved in politics. He has sharply criticised the president in the past and accused him of \"fearing the people\".\nThe president has not taken this challenge lightly. He has accused Bobi Wine of being a foreign agent of those \"who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda\" and said that opposition figures are misleading young people to get involved in violence on the campaign trail. \nBobi Wine has been arrested several times since he became involved in politics. He has spoken of a \"revolution\" against Mr Museveni. \n using the hashtag \"WeAreRemovingADictator\".\nPart of Bobi Wine's popularity comes down to his age. At 38, he is just half as old as President Museveni, in one of the youngest nations on earth. \n Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide, of just 15.7 - only Niger is younger. \nThe \"ghetto president\" grew up in a slum in the capital, Kampala. His background and his efforts to promote social justice in his country through his music and as a politician have endeared him to this younger, more urban generation. \nBut Bobi Wine has also surprised authorities by drawing big crowds of supporters in rural areas - thought to be a bastion of support for President Museveni.\nTensions are high, and the campaign has been marred by serious violence, which has left dozens killed and hundreds more arrested. \nOfficials have cited measures brought in to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic for their efforts to break up political gatherings. But \n that security forces are using these regulations \"as a pretext to violate rights and clamp down on the opposition and the media\". \n for allegedly breaching Covid measures. His detention sparked protest which led to a wave of arrests and left dozens dead, mostly allegedly shot by the security forces.\nAfterwards, \n and said \"police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence\".\n\"Can I repeat? Police have a right to shoot you and you die for nothing.... do it at your own risk.\"\nBobi Wine has since taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest and helmet on the campaign trail. \nAt the end of last year he halted his campaign after a number of his team were injured as security forces dispersed one of his political rallies. He later told broadcaster CNN he had survived several assassination attempts. \nA country of more than 42 million people, Uganda is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nIt has one of the highest refugee populations worldwide, hosting \n from neighbouring countries. \nSome are watching the political unrest in the country with concern, and worry about what could happen after the vote. There has never been a peaceful transfer of power in Uganda and it is not clear what would happen if Mr Museveni were to lose, and what the military would do.\nThe president announced a shake-up of the armed forces in November, bringing in the former head of Uganda's operations in Somalia, Maj Gen Paul Lokech, as deputy inspector general of police to coordinate security forces around the capital during the election period. \nThe European Union has chosen not to send observers to the election this year - reportedly because \n to make polling more fair - meaning there will be less international scrutiny.

The opposition says this is because it is popular in those areas, but the government says the measure is due to Covid-19 restrictions. \n\"We found this network to be linked to the government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda,\" Facebook said in a statement. \n\"They used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were,\" the statement continued. \nBut government spokesman Ofwono Opondo hit back in a \n, accusing Facebook of failing to adhere to \"natural justice\" and echoing suggestions by other government figures that the social network is trying to influence the election outcome. \n\"We are not familiar with anybody who complains about these accounts,\" he said. \"The owners have not received any notice and no-one was asked to make any response to the allegations.\"\nMr Opondo described Facebook as high-handed. \"I think they are playing the usual games,\" he added. \"We know that they have a side in this election perhaps.\" \nThe government spokesman said Thursday's elections would be free and fair.\nThe BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that the campaign period has been dominated by social media, as political parties moved to reach a young, politically aware population.\nMany new accounts promoting messages from both the ruling party and the opposition have popped up in the last couple of months, especially on Facebook and Twitter. In many cases, the users did not use proper names, and shared content filled with hate messages and fake news, she says. \nUgandans online have said saying that the government has finally got a taste of what it feels like to be censured.\nIn December, the Uganda Communications Commission, the media industry regulator, wrote to Google, asking it to shut down several YouTube channels associated with Bobi Wine.\nIn the past, the government body has ordered online content creators such as influencers and bloggers to register and have their material vetted before publication, but this was put on hold after it was challenged in court. \nDuring the 2016 election, the government blocked social media on polling day and for several after, which led to the proliferation of VPN use in the country.\nIt feels like there is a fresh wind blowing through social media in terms of how it deals with political content.\nFirst we saw US President Donald Trump banned from Twitter and Facebook and now that has been extended beyond the US to Africa. \nFacebook has shut a slew of accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials, accusing them of \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\" in the public debate ahead of Thursday's election.\nMark Zuckerberg has long insisted that the platform he founded has to allow all forms of free speech and cannot become an arbiter of political conversations.\nSo what has changed? The truth is that the platform has increasingly focused on misinformation in recent years but the violence and chaos witnessed at the heart of the US government in recent days have forced it to speed up these attempts, and make some pretty big decisions.\nThe days of describing itself as a mere conduit for content seem to be well and truly over.\nIt has tried lots of ways to reduce misinformation, including ranking reliable journalism higher than fake news and training algorithms to identify \"bad\" posts, but it has had mixed results.\nBut now with all eyes on it, it is going to have to find a way to deal with content in a way that pleases politicians, its users and its advertisers, who do not want to be associated with a platform that is being accused of inciting unrest or influencing the results of elections.\nIt remains unclear how it will do so in the long term but in the short term expect more knee-jerk reactions to political events around the world.\nAnd the new look for the social network will come at a price.\nSome Ugandan officials are already accusing it of meddling in its election. Facebook could be stuck between a rock and a hard place for some time to come."},

So I lowered the prices, as it was more important to protect people than to think of profit,\" the 35-year-old tells the BBC.\n\"I had to increase my production by 75% to meet the demand when the pandemic started, so Covid-19 has been good for my business.\n\"But I made sure I gave free soap to vulnerable people such as the elderly and the disabled.\"\nMr Havyarimana's initiative has been praised by the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, which often highlights the contribution of refugee entrepreneurs to their host communities.\n\"The refugees are playing a pivotal role in helping contain the spread of Covid-19 in Kakuma,\" Eujin Byun, a spokesperson for UNHCR in Kenya tells the BBC.\n\"They helped in many ways, from disseminating information about the virus to helping people take the necessary measures.\"\nShe added that she was not surprised by Mr Havyarimana's decision to lower prices.\n\"Refugees are very community-oriented and they will look after each other. They have previously stepped up and helped us do our jobs in situations like that.\"\nMr Havyarimana currently employs 42 people in his business, named Glap Industries - short for God Loves All People. The bulk of the workers are refugees but 18 are Kenyans from the town of Kakuma.\nGlap supplies local businesses and institutions outside the camp and even relief agencies.\n\"The agencies buy my soaps to give away to refugees who cannot afford them and for their own staff too,\" the Burundian proudly notes. \nMr Havyarimana is not the only local soap merchant, but he does not fear the competition, and in fact offers classes to teach people how to make cleaning products.\n\"I want to mentor women and younger people so they can have an opportunity to become self-reliant and improve their lives like I did,\" he says.\n\"I want to help the community in any way I can.\" \nEfforts like his may have helped keep Covid-19 at bay in Kakuma. \nThe most recent UNHCR figures, dating from 24 December, show that there had been 341 confirmed cases with 19 people under medical care. There have been 10 deaths from the virus.\nKenya has registered nearly 100,000 cases nationally, with around 1,700 deaths, health ministry figures show.\nPolitical instability and violence have forced more than 300,000 people to flee Burundi to neighbouring African countries in the last decade, according to the UNHCR.\nMr Havyarimana was in the middle of his chemistry studies at the University of Burundi when he left. He says his life was in danger and that he was receiving death threats from relatives of his late mother, who also seized his home.\nAfter arriving in Kakuma, he wanted to make money for himself, rather than relying on humanitarian aid.\nThe camp sits in an isolated and arid region where the provision of basic services is a challenge for relief agencies. \nExploring the region, Mr Havyarimana noticed there was not a soap factory, which meant that cleaning products had to be brought from elsewhere.\n\"I had no idea of how to make soap, so I started surfing the web for some knowledge,\" he explains.\nHe later enrolled in a soap-making course offered by the World Lutheran Federation aid agency, and with a loan from a former classmate in Burundi, he started the business alongside two helpers.\nHe also received grants from relief agencies including the UNHCR and NGOs such as the African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC), which says it has supported more then 18,000 refugee entrepreneurs.\n\"Innocent's story shows how refugees can contribute to their host communities in a number of ways,\" Julienne Oyler, the AEC's chair, tells the BBC.\n\"Camps like Kakuma are so isolated that entrepreneurs like him are a lifeline to basic goods and services at a time of lockdowns and other restrictions.\"\nA 2018 World Bank study identified over 2,000 businesses in Kakuma and estimated that they contributed more than $50m (\u00a337m) to the local economy every year.\nMichelle Richey, a lecturer in technology and entrepreneurship at the UK's Loughborough University specialising in refugee business ventures, says people like Mr Havyarimana are very import in changing the general perception of refugees.\n\"The human potential within refugees shows when we give them chances to work instead of just focusing on humanitarian issues,\" she says.\n\"We can help those people have some control of their lives again after all they have been through.\"\nStarting a thriving business is not the only change in Mr Havyarimana's life since arriving in Kakuma. In 2017, he married Aline, a fellow Burundian refugee he met at the camp. \nThey have two sons, and the youngest one, Prince, was born in late November. \nMr Havyarimana speaks with fondness about life in Kenya but he dreams of being resettled in Australia or Canada. \n\"I like Kakuma a lot, but I want to give my wife and kids a better life,\" he says.\nIn the meantime, Mr Havyarimana is focusing on expanding his ways to help the community, and as well as offering 21 kinds of soap and cleaning products, he has devised a hand sanitiser created from aloe vera grown in a patch just outside his workshop.\n\"Coronavirus has affected the whole world but for us here in Kakuma, it has made it even more important that we clean our hands in any we can,\" he says."},

Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony.\nThis is the second time Democrats have pursued impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nIn December 2019, the House impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020.\nNo US president has ever been impeached twice.\nHowever, the prospect of an impeachment conviction is unlikely because of Mr Trump's broad Republican support in the Senate.\nThe resolution drafted by three Democrats - who began writing it while under lockdown in the Capitol last Wednesday - consists of one article: \"Incitement of insurrection\".\n\"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,\" the resolution reads.\nIn the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in \"imminent lawless action at the Capitol\".\nThe resolution also says this was \"consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct\" the certification of President-elect Biden's election win.\n\"He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,\" the resolution says.\nImpeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial.\nArticles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial to decide whether to convict or not. There is no appeal against outcome.\nAn impeachment is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nMr Trump was the third US president to be impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were also left in office by the Senate.\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached in 1974, as political pressure built over the Watergate scandal.\nOn Monday, the Democrats presented a resolution to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president and the cabinet to declare Mr Trump unfit for office.\nThe resolution urged Mr Pence to \"declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the president is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office\".\nBut, as expected, the resolution was not adopted by unanimous consent in the House, after Republican Alex Mooney of West Virginia objected to the request.\nThe House has now gone into recess until Tuesday morning, when the chamber is expected to vote on the resolution.\nAfter the vote, the Democrats said they will give Mr Pence 24 hours to remove Mr Trump from office before they move toward impeachment.\n\"The president's threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,\" Speaker Pelosi said.\nAlthough Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment.\nImpeachments are usually long, drawn-out affairs, involving investigations and hearings that can take weeks to conclude. This impeachment is expected to be much quicker. \nMonday's presentation of the impeachment article to the House paves the way for a vote to be held. A simple majority in favour of impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Senate.\nHowever, an internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires.\nThe Senate is currently not in session, and all 100 senators would have to agree to change the schedule, which is highly unlikely.\nConstitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial when Mr Trump leaves office. But Democrats appear confident that the House can impeach Mr Trump and send the articles to the Senate for a trial at a later date.\nOn Sunday, Democratic House whip James Clyburn said the party may not send any articles to the Senate for trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office.\nIt's a new week in Washington DC, but the fallout from Wednesday's tragic events are just beginning.  \nWith only eight days left of Mr Trump's presidency, Democrats are very aware of the disruption an impeachment and a Senate trial would cause to the early days of Mr Biden's administration.\nThat's why there is talk of delaying Mr Trump's Senate trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office. \nAt that point, the pressure to remove Mr Trump will be past, but other punishments - stripping him of the accommodations and privileges ex-presidents enjoy and prohibiting him from future federal office - still apply.\nA year ago, Senate Republicans voted as a block to acquit the president of impeachment charges. This time, however, there may be some willing to side with Democrats to make sure that Trump, once out of power, never returns again."},

He was later arrested by local police and the FBI for his role in the riots. \nFootage shows Mr Jensen leading the mob that chased Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts \"second floor!\" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber. \nAfter Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves Mr Jensen - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself, luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. \nThe image of Mr Goodman trailed by a mob - some armed with Confederate flags, others with allusions to the Nazi flag - was  extremely disturbing, Mr Burkhalter said. \n\"Police officer, not a police officer, to see a black man being chased by someone carrying a confederate flag - there is something wrong with that picture. That should never happen again,\" he said. \n\"It just reeks of everything we need to correct.\"  \nOfficer Goodman has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. \n\"As Trump's fascist mob ransacked the US Capitol, this brave USCP officer kept murderous rioters away from the Senate chamber and saved the lives of those inside,\" wrote congressman Bill Pascal on Twitter. \n\"Last Wednesday, I was inside the Senate chamber when Officer Eugene Goodman led an angry mob away from it at great personal risk. His quick thinking and decisive action that day likely saved lives, and we owe him a debt of gratitude,\" wrote Senator Bob Casey on Monday. \nMr Goodman's standoff with the mob came just minutes before authorities were able to seal the chamber, according to reporting from the Washington Post.\nMembers of the 2,000-person Capitol police department are tasked with protecting the Capitol building and those inside of it. They are separate from DC police, who patrol the rest of the city. \nThe chief of the Capitol Police Steven Sund resigned last week following criticism over his force's response to the riots, including a public call from top Democrat Nancy Pelosi for Mr Sund to step down. \nActing US Attorney Michael Sherwin has said that the Justice Department will consider pursuing criminal charges against any Capitol police officers found to be complicit with the rioters. \nOfficer Howard Liebengood, 51, who was on duty during the riots died by suicide on Saturday, his family has said.

There were 112 positive cases at the 66 EFL clubs in its most recent round of testing. \nThe Football Association will be reminding everyone of their responsibilities.\nIt is understood there are no plans to halt elite sport but government ministers are concerned that the images from dressing rooms could make it harder to defend its continuation. \nA Whitehall source confirmed to the BBC that the celebrations at Chorley and Crawley Town had been noted by ministers, who last week warned football's authorities they had to do all they could to justify elite sport carrying on.\nIn his letter written to clubs on Monday, seen by BBC Sport, EFL chief executive Birch also said: \"Throughout the pandemic, football has provided a glimmer of hope for many millions of people affected by restrictions but we all understand the scrutiny the game remains under.\n\"While football is permitted to continue the actions of all participants will clearly be under the microscope. \n\"I am therefore personally asking you to re-double your efforts, to check, amend and tighten your protocol accordingly, and ensure that players and staff are left in no doubt as to their responsibilities on matchdays.\"\nProfessor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told BBC Breakfast that allowing team sports to continue was \"a balancing act\".\n\"The balancing act is trying to minimise the amount of contact outside very structured environments while trying to keep some semblance of life as will all know it,\" he said.  \n\"It is very much a matter for individuals in their day-to-day life. We have all got to say what, in our own lives, can we do to minimise the amount of impact we have on the NHS and the vulnerable?\"\nElite sport is not quite in the last-chance saloon, but the exemption it has been granted, at a time when grassroots sport has had to stop, cannot be taken for granted. \nA suspension is not yet imminent, but there are also no guarantees, especially if infection rates continue to rise, hospitals become overwhelmed, and the national lockdown has to be strengthened further. The government's patience seems to be wearing thin after the scenes of crowded dressing-room celebrations made a mockery of the social-distancing protocols that clubs were reminded of. \nThe optics of on-field hugs and handshakes, and fans gathering outside grounds, beamed into millions of homes at a time when the government is desperate for the public to stay at home and avoid contact with other households, is highly unhelpful to those making the case for professional sport to be allowed to continue. \nMy understanding is that ministers and medical experts' concerns do not amount to a final warning; they realise that the coverage of elite sport encourages people to stay at home and helps to retain some normality and balance in people's lives, and that protocols have largely been successful in suppressing transmission around training and fixtures. \nBut having warned sports bodies of their responsibilities last week, the government does now expect to see the football authorities in particular redouble their efforts, and for players' behaviour to reflect the privilege they enjoy in being able to continue to work when there has been so much disruption in so many people's work and lives. \nCertainly, football can ill afford any more high-profile breaches of the guidelines by players when away from their clubs.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the rules around celebrations in particular could be \"difficult to understand\".\n\"To control emotions when you are playing at 200mph is very difficult,\" he said on Monday.\n\"We are asking our players at corners, for example, to be man-marking people, pushing people around and not fist-bump anyone.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola voiced similar concerns, saying: \"When one guy scores a goal, I don't know if they can be controlled and not celebrate it.\n\"The joy to celebrate it, I don't know if [a player] is going to think: 'I cannot hug my mate for two, three seconds'.\"\nWolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo described the increase of cases as \"scary\".\n\"What I'm afraid of is the decision to stop - football as we know now will not be the same,\" he said.\n\"This is my biggest fear because the schedule will go crazy.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said: \"Everyone knows the situation and if it gets suspended I don't think it'd be a surprise.\n\"We'll just go with what the Government and Premier League have to say and, if it's the case to carry on, we'll carry on. But I don't think I'm being controversial if I say I don't think anyone would be surprised if we don't carry on with the way it's sweeping through the country.\"\nDespite fans not being allowed to attend matches, football still allows for some sense of escapism - a point Arteta emphasised.\n\"We know what we can bring to society if we are able to do it in safe way,\" he said.\n\"There are a lot of positives to take but it is just that balance. When we are still safe, we can add something positive without this difficult context.\""},

But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents.\nDuring the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of him stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\" \nFor this revolutionary the harvest is still not over.\nMy introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out. \nThe piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings.\nIt is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity.\nHe is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure.\nMany young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language).\nBut the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around. \nIn his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the last election, he has been traversing the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets.\nAnd with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni has been keen to show his vitality. Last April, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November. \n\"If your father loves you, he has to empower you. In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern.\nThe economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power.\nOne of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty. \n\"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says.\n\"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent\u2026 he is an Africanist.\"\nNevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005.\nIndeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm.\nJournalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life.\n\"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote.\nBut something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits. \nHe had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age. \nAnd then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building. \nMany saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life.\nIt is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president. \nThe significance of patronage extends right through society.\nIt sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution.\nBut his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years.\n\"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council.\nWhile acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\".\nDespite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority.\nThe judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government. \nWhen judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.\nFor example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. \n\"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple.\nWhen it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment.\nThe media has also had its independence threatened.\nOn the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni. \n\"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala.\nBut outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds.\nBut perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered.\nAs it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents.\nKizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, once Mr Museveni's physician, first ran against him in the 2001 election. He has been detained and prosecuted on numerous charges, including rape and treason, but has never been convicted.\nNow that Bobi Wine, a singer whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is mounting a serious challenge to the president's rule, he has become the latest politician to face the wrath of the men in uniform.\nThe MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped. \nOn the campaign trail for this election, the police have arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups.\nDuring two days of protests in November following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces.\nSticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face.\nThrough his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control. He has also managed to reinvent himself. \nWhereas he was once the political upstart in his early 40s, anyone taking on that role now risks incurring his considerable wrath."},

The Mexica called the foodstuff \ntecuitlatl\n, a Nahuatl word that roughly translates to \"rock excrement\", though they held it in decidedly higher esteem than its name suggests.\n\"Oral traditions say that the Mexica couriers and runners in ancient Tenochtitlan would eat dried spirulina cakes with corn, tortillas, beans, chillies or mole as fuel for long-distance travel,\" said Denise Vallejo, an indigenous first-generation Xicana chef who runs the vegan Los Angeles pop-up \nAlchemy Organica\n.\nEven without modern science, the Mexica could recognise the nutrient density that has made spirulina such a favourite today. It boasts about 60-70% protein by weight and has essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals, especially iron, manganese and B vitamins, according to the Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements. It's so healthy and relatively easy to grow, in fact, that \nexperts think it could be a potential food source for future Mars colonies\n.\nOf course, to the arriving Spanish conquistadors in the 16th Century, it mostly just looked odd. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo wrote in his 1568 memoir about \"a species of bread made of a kind of mud or slime collected from the surface of the lake, and eaten in that form, and has a similar taste to our cheese.\" And Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan included illustrations of spirulina harvesting in his 16th-Century ethnographic study, the Florentine Codex.\n\"After the Spanish invasion, most of its consumption declined with the draining of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico,\" Vallejo said. \"And many of the Spanish didn't enjoy its 'cheesy' or 'slimy' properties. Knowledge of its consumption was lost for a long time.\"\nThe Western world rediscovered the nutritious ingredient in the 1940s, when a French phycologist (a scientist who studies algae) noticed the Kanembu people along Africa's Lake Chad harvesting spirulina and turning it into sun-dried cakes called \ndih\u00e9\n. But it didn't make its grand return to Mexico until a happy accident in the 1960s, when the owners of Sosa Texcoco \u2013 which produced sodium carbonate and calcium chloride in a large snail-shaped pond on the remnants of Lake Texcoco \u2013 noticed a green substance mucking up the works. They reached out to French researchers, who concluded that it was the same organism that had been nourishing the Kanembu for generations. Rather than try to eradicate the cyanobacteria, Sosa Texcoco recognized its value, encouraged its growth and opened the world's first commercial spirulina company, Spirulina Mexicana.\nWhile Spirulina Mexicana has since closed, a micro-farm on the outskirts of San Miguel de Allende called \nSpirulina Viva\n is continuing the ancient tradition. Since 2010, American expat Katie Kohlstedt and her San Luis Potos\u00ed-born husband, Francisco Portillo, have grown fresh spirulina that probably tastes remarkably similar to what the Mexica harvested centuries ago. \"We're really proud to grow it here,\" she said. \"We didn't have to invent something new or bring something from somewhere else.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\n\u2022 \nMexico's ancient caviar\n\u2022 \nWhere there's no queso in quesadilla\n\u2022 \nMexico City's walking fish\nWhile many people may be familiar with spirulina in its dehydrated powdered form, Spirulina Viva sells the green stuff raw and frozen, which imparts a much more delicate flavour. \"Fresh spirulina should be creamy like a spreadable cheese,\" Kohlstedt said. \"If you closed your eyes, you might think you were eating a cross between an avocado and spinach.\" She noted that if you think of spirulina as fishy or an acquired taste, chances are you've been buying a lesser-quality product \u2013 or even one that uses ground fish bones to provide the phosphorus the spirulina needs to grow.\nKohlstedt and Portillo lead spirulina-growing workshops and have welcomed future farmers from as far away as Australia and Argentina. \"It's gardening combined with chemistry,\" Kohlstedt said of the process. But for many consumers, the finished product still remains a bit of a mystery. \"If I read one more article that said spirulina is grown in the ocean or [that shows] a picture of seaweed, I'm just going to scream,\" she said, with a laugh. \"My other two least favourite words are 'pond scum'. I think that's really offensive actually!\"\nKohlstedt recommends eating spirulina as simply as possible, stirred into warm miso soup or bone broth, blended into a smoothie, spread on bread or mixed into guacamole with extra lime juice, because vitamin C has been shown to help iron absorption. \"You're going to feel like you just ate Popeye's lunch,\" she said.\nIn Mexico City, chefs are getting even more creative with the ingredient. You might find spirulina dusting a tlayuda topped with avocado and \nescamoles \n(ant larvae) at \nBalc\u00f3n del Z\u00f3calo\n; brightening a superfood tortilla at \nCintli Tortilleria\n; adding a verdant punch to the smoothie bowls and cheesecakes at \nVegamo\n; and even spiking cocktails at the pre-Hispanic-inspired \nXam\na\nn Bar\n.\nThere, head bartender Kenneth Rodrigez has incorporated spirulina into a number of drinks, including a gin-based cocktail with Mexican lime and asparagus liqueur. \"I use it when somebody doesn't like egg whites or [in drinks for] vegan people, because spirulina has protein and we can get interesting textures,\" Rodrigez said, \"not to mention the incredible colour and the nutritional components that it provides.\"\u00a0\nHe describes the taste notes as \"green, herbal and \nclorofila \n(chlorophyll),\" and said that \"it can be used to enhance other flavours, because it has lots of minerals, like an alternative for salt.\"\u00a0\nAcross the border in Mexican American communities, using spirulina has meant establishing a direct connection with a pre-Hispanic past. At San Antonio's inventive Mexican restaurant \nMixtli\n, for instance, chefs Rico Torres and Diego Galicia featured spirulina on a special menu inspired by the Spanish conquest, and they participated in a collaborative D\u00eda de los Muertos dinner at New York's \nJames\nBeard House\n, where one of the hors d'oeuvres was a smoked spirulina yogurt with trout roe and radishes.\nAt Alchemy Organica, Vallejo incorporates spirulina powder into a pineapple \nagua fresca\n (a Mexican drink made with water, sugar and pureed fruits, seeds, flowers or grains for flavour) with lime and chia seeds. And she has even used it as \"a natural food colouring and nutritional boost, along with cactus and spinach powders\" to make vibrant green \nmasa\n (dough made with corn that has been nixtamalized, or treated with an alkaline solution), which she turns into colourful tortillas and tamales. \"I also use it as a flavour enhancer for some of my seafood-inspired dishes, as it imparts a flavour much like seaweed,\" she explained.\u00a0\nAnd when one of her cooks began selling fresh spirulina at a farmer's market, Vallejo took to simply scooping spoonfuls into her drinks. \"It gives you energy like you'd expect from a cup of coffee!\" she said.\nIn a sense, these chefs are tapping into something much deeper than simply taste or nutrition. Vallejo, who studies \ncuranderismo \n(folk medicine), said that spirulina is often viewed as a detoxifier to prepare for rituals, spells and \"visionary plant ceremonies\". And Kohlstedt has similarly heard about the ingredient's mystical connections, which draw on the similarities between spirulina's helical shape and our own building blocks as humans: \"Someone told me that the reason it's called 'spirulina' has to do with its spiral form, but that it also has to do with our DNA and how there is something really basic and spiritual about how we relate to plants [and cyanobacteria].\"\n\"So many of the 'superfoods' enjoyed today have a rich history in Mesoamerica: chia, amaranth, cacao, avocado, cactus,\" Vallejo noted. \"I think the current decolonising movement in Xicanx, Central American and other Spanish-speaking communities is helping us to rediscover and remember our ancestral foodways. We get to take back our foods and our plant wisdom.

Production will begin in late spring.\nThe trailer for the HBO Max show gives nothing away; It features numerous shots of New York, but none of the characters is seen on screen. \n\"I grew up with these characters, and I can't wait to see how their story has evolved in this new chapter, with the honesty, poignancy, humour and the beloved city that has always defined them,\" Sarah Aubrey, head of original content at HBO Max, said in a statement.\nThe original Sex and the City series, created by Darren Star, was based on Candace Bushnell's 1997 book of the same name. It premiered on HBO in 1998 and ran for six seasons until 2004.\nThe show inspired two films, Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010.

Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it.\nBluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features.\nRaising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well.\nWi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in. \nConnecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers.\nUsing a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale.\nWorldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, \n.\nSmartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia.\nTaiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step.\nBut some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough.\nAs principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks.\nHe says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems. \n\"I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely.\"\nThere is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability. \n\"Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,\" he says.\nAnother challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi. \n\"Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,\" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks.\n\"The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,\" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly. \nOne solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection.\nIt can also be tricky to install smart locks.\nYale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws. \nHelpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky.\n\"I'm a bit of a door nerd now,\" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks.\nFor fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy. \nOne workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether. \nA server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. \"The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,\" she says. \nLock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens. \nSome want an \"active command and control experience\" using Siri or Alexa. \nBut others long for locks to \"do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,\" he says.\nIf we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in.\nThey can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.\nIf you, or someone you know, are affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) "},

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Atlanta and Feud: Bette and Joan. \nThe Sex Pistols electrified British music and, depending on who you believed, threatened the very fabric of society at the tail end of the 1970s. \nThey may only have survived for two years, but their angry, nihilistic singles and violent performances changed the idea of what rock and roll could be. \nOriginally formed in 1972 by Jones and drummer Paul Cook, they were galvanized by the addition of John Lydon - aka Johnny Rotten - whose abrasive vocals and anti-establishment lyrics defined the band and, to a large extent, the British punk movement.\nThey only released one album, but the sheer sonic force of songs like Anarchy In The UK, God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant became symbols of Britain's social and political turmoil, as youth unemployment soared, with young people particularly affected.\nNot that everyone was impressed by the Sex Pistols' curious combination of anger and apathy. \nTheir singles were blacklisted on the British charts and a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying their album cover. Facing bans across the UK, the group had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. - \"Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly\".\nAlways on the verge of chaos, they finally split up on a US tour in 1978. \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" a tired and disillusioned Johnny Rotten asked the audience at their final show - but their legacy was ensured.\n\"Imagine breaking into the world of The Crown and Downton Abbey with your mates and screaming your songs and your fury at all they represent,\" said Boyle, announcing his new project. \n\"This is the moment that British society and culture changed forever. It is the detonation point for British street culture... where ordinary young people had the stage and vented their fury and their fashion\u2026and everyone had to watch and listen\".\nThe series is based on Steve Jones's memoir, Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol; which doesn't just focus on his time with the band.\nIt begins in West London, where the young musician suffered maternal neglect and sexual abuse by a step-father, and quickly fell into crime - including an attempt to climb the chimneys of Battersea Power Station, and stealing amps from a David Bowie gig.\nAfter becoming entranced by the glam rock scene, he is taken under the wings of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who helped form, style and promote the Sex Pistols.\nThe book demystifies the band behind the myth - showing how they struggled with the criticisms lobbed their way and the pressure of living up to their image, including the moment Jones was goaded into swearing live on primetime TV.\nLater chapters deal with his battles with addiction, and his recent reinvention as a tee-total \"semi-retired sexual deviant who doesn't really act out so much any more\".\nBritish-born, Australian-raised actor Toby Wallace will play Jones, following eye-catching roles in the coming-of-age drama Babyteeth and Netflix drama The Society, where he played evil teen Campbell Elliot.\nAnson Boon, last seen in the Kate Winslet tear-jerker Blackbird takes on the spittle-flecked role of Johnny Rotten; while out-of-control bassist Sid Vicious will be played by Louis Partridge.\nSydney Chandler - daughter of film star Kyle - will become Pretenders star Chrissie Hynde, who had an affair with Jones at the height of the Sex Pistols' fame.\nThe Witcher's Emma Appleton is cast as Nancy Spungen, the American girlfriend of Sid Vicious, who died in mysterious circumstances in October 1978.\nAnd Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams plays \"the face of punk\", the iconoclastic model and actress Pamela Rooke, whose signature style - ripped fishnets, dominatrix heels and raccoon-like eye make-up - defined the scene.\nThe Sex Pistols project isn't the only musical series in the pipeline.

I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual.\nBut then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read. \nWith a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now.\nParler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too.\nTechnology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons.\n\"Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,\" she said.\nIt's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too.\nAgain, this is not unheard of. \nGab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days.\nWhat is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president.\nSince Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch.\nYouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance.\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as \"problematic\".\nEU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as \"the 9/11 moment of social media\", \n that \"the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing\".\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now \"taking editorial decisions\", adding that platforms were \"choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice\".\nElsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship.\nHe tweeted: \"The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship.\"\nThe fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter.\nOne of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse.\nPlatforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies.\nBut since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders.\nIn March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation.\nIt wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence.\nThe president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\".\nSocial media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets \"a pivotal precedent\" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post.\nSome analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide.\nOn Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election.\nPrivacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants. \n\"Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world. I think the president's removal might be the beginning of a purge for similar behaviour globally.\"\nIn his final hours on Twitter, Mr Trump once again blamed a piece of US legislation called Section 230 for \"banning\" free speech. During his presidency he threatened to repeal the law which makes social networks largely exempt from liability for their users' post.\nMany argue that removing the protection would actually harm free speech as networks would be forced to moderate far more than they currently do.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden has also stated that he would like to repeal the law to increase moderation and reduce the spread of fake news.\nIn the same final tweet Mr Trump said that he has been negotiating with \"various other sites\" and that there would be \"a big announcement soon\".\nIf the events of recent days are anything to go by, Mr Trump and some of his supporters face an uphill struggle against not just lawmakers but tech giants too before they can establish themselves on mainstream social media."},

On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021.\nBBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch.\nThe fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation.\nA recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground.\nVaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than\nfirst doses had been administered. \nBut some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses.\nMuch of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order.\nGermany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. \nMr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand.\nGermany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer.\nThe Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager.\nBut the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. \"We believed when we contributed \u20ac12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,\" he told a newspaper this week.\nThe country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to \n people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. \nIt has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature.\nHowever, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer.\nFrance's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to \n - still so small as to be statistically meaningless.  \nSo why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used.\nThe primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. \nEach recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives.\nAnother problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers.\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings.\nPolitically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a \"state scandal\", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free.\nRussia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity.\nSputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded.\nA poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week that \n had been vaccinated.\nBut one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown.\nRussia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped.\nAlmost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is still \nof how many others have received the vaccination. \nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains \"feasible\". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. \nAlongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February.\nSwedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine.\nA successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. \nMeanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands.\nIt seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further \nelderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial.\nThe mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be \"seamless and fast\", tweeting: \"If that does not work, shoot me.\"\nThe first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September.\nYou may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed.\nAfter getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its \"careful\" approach.\nAnd there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. \nIn a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least.\nSpain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with \npeople vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. \nEach of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. \nGovernment data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. \nAlthough vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination.\nHowever, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. \nThe arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by \"political affiliations or parliamentary needs\", a claim the central government has rejected.

He has worked closely, for several years, with Prof Yong-Zhen Zhang, who was at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control in Beijing.\nProf Zhang sequenced the genome of the virus that closed down the world. \nHe collected samples taken from some of the first patients in Wuhan Central Hospital, where a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases had emerged.

Prof Zhang and Prof Holmes quickly submitted a paper describing what they had seen and, as the week wore on, a buzz of public health speculation about what the novel virus might be started on social media.\n\"I didn't sleep,\" Prof Holmes tells me. \"It was weighing on my conscience.\" In Sydney, it was early on 11 January when Prof Holmes phoned his colleague in China and asked his permission to publish the sequence. \"Zhang was on a plane, strapped into his seat,\" Prof Holmes recalled. \"He told me he needed to think about it - there was some pressure not to release too much information about the outbreak.\n\"He called me back about a minute later and said, 'OK, let's do it.'\"\nA researcher in Prof Zhang's lab emailed the genetic code to Eddie Holmes, who called a colleague in Edinburgh, in the UK. \"It was about 01:00 there,\" Prof Holmes recalls. \nIn the ensuing 52 minutes, the scientists together wrote a brief post explaining that they were \"releasing a coronavirus genome from a case of a respiratory disease from the Wuhan outbreak\" and uploaded the code. Their post said that researchers should please \"feel free to download, share, use and analyse this data\".\nWith that post, \n - the code that makes the coronavirus - was available to any scientist with an internet connection.\nIt set off 12 months of break-neck scientific endeavour. If you search the \n, you will retrieve more than 90,000 results. \n\"If we didn't collaborate with colleagues in China - if I wasn't working with and talking to Zhang - that sequence wouldn't have gone online as early as it did,\" says Prof Holmes.\nThat same weekend, scientists at a US pharmaceutical company called Moderna, which had never previously brought a product to market, downloaded the genome and started work on their experimental vaccine. Scientists at Pfizer did the same.\nThere are multiple methods - traditional and experimental - for making vaccines, but Moderna and Pfizer use an experimental approach based on something called mRNA (or Messenger ribonucleic acid). The terminology is a mouthful, but it describes a simpler, swifter approach to vaccine production. And it was boosted over the clinical finish line by the pandemic.   \nVaccination is fundamentally based on \"showing\" your immune system the disease-causing agent, so it can form a biological memory and be primed to fight it. For many existing virus vaccines, this has meant producing versions or pieces of the virus itself - often snippets of viral protein stripped of their disease-causing ability. These are grown inside chicken eggs, packaged up and injected.\n\"To grow enough of those things can take a very long time - sometimes years,\" explains Prof Robert Langer, one of the founders of Moderna, and a professor of chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US. \"With mRNA - you use the body as a factory to make that protein. So rather than have a giant plant with all these eggs to grow your proteins, you just make the mRNA, give it to the patient and the patient does everything else.\"\nMessenger RNA is a short sequence of coded genetic instructions for the protein you want a cell to make.\n\"I've been working on this technology for decades,\" says Prof Langer. \"This is actually the ninth mRNA vaccine that Moderna has developed.\" The others, which include vaccines that are designed to prime people's immune systems to fight their own cancer, are still in clinical trials.\n\"But when the pandemic hit, this technology lent itself to doing things as rapidly as possible.\"\nThere are now more than 150 coronavirus vaccines in some stage of development. But Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, which it developed in partnership with the German company BioNTech, was the first to receive emergency authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration. It was quickly followed by Moderna's vaccine - less than a year after scientists first downloaded the genome it was based on.\nIt was not until the end of January that the World Health Organization called the coronavirus outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern\". And it took until March for the WHO to officially declare a pandemic. Efforts to understand the virus - to find out where it came from, how to treat it and learn how it was evolving - were already moving almost as rapidly as the pandemic.\n\"With that genome, we didn't need the actual virus,\" explains Dr Dalan Bailey from the UK's Pirbright Institute. \"We could take that code and actually get the part of the virus that we wanted to study synthesised [using the genome as a blueprint] and have it in our lab within days.\n\"That definitely allowed us to start our research much more quickly.\"\nDr Bailey and his colleagues study how exactly the coronavirus latches on to and hijacks each cell. Key to this are those spikes we now see on every graphic depiction of the spherical coronavirus structure. Not only is the spike protein the key that unlocks viral entry into a cell, it is also the part of the virus that is most frequently recognised by our immune systems, so understanding its shape and its function is critical to optimising vaccines.  \nBy the end of March, with many European countries in lockdown, Chinese scientists had mapped \n.\nKnowing what the protein physically looks like means researchers can work out how antibodies bind to it. That is critical, because antibodies are the immune system's memory proteins. Immune cells produce antibodies to fit a specific invader - a virus that they have previously encountered in the form of a vaccine, perhaps. The antibodies then latch onto it and tag it for destruction. \"So this ultimately helps us design better vaccines,\" explained Dr Bailey.\nThroughout summer months in the northern hemisphere, lockdowns (temporarily and patchily) eased, but international tension did not. Even as US President Donald Trump sought to blame China for \"unleashing a plague\", scientists in the US and China carried on working together. By June, scientists from both countries had \n.\nPresident Jair Bolsanaro of Brazil, which remains one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, made baseless, very unscientific claims that Brazilians were somehow \"immune\" to the disease. Meanwhile, scientists there were \n amid a national funding crisis. \nOne large international effort, called the \n, saw investigators from research centres in Europe, Asia, and North America share data on how our own genes might affect how sick the coronavirus makes us.\nThere is no single, simple answer to the question of why some people have no symptoms at all, while others are made extremely ill by Covid-19. But many of these efforts to solve that puzzle have focused on the \"lock\" on our cells that the virus uses to gain access.\nIt is called the Ace-2 receptor. It is a biological lock that has evolved to be opened by chemical keys that occur naturally. That mechanism is fundamental to the biochemical machinery that is constantly whirring in healthy cells. Ace-2, for example, can be used as a cellular doorway by proteins that regulate our blood pressure. \nThe coronavirus, however, has cleverly (and unfortunately) evolved to fit that same lock.\nLike every building block of our bodies, the exact shape and function of our Ace-2 receptors is written in our genes, giving researchers valuable clues about who is most vulnerable to Covid-19.\nWhile there is no single coded clue to predict how sick we might be made by Covid, several studies of patients have spotted \n that might be linked with the severity of their illness.\nOne intriguing genetic study by German and Japanese scientists showed that a \n that the virus can use to hijack our cells.\nExamining the shape of the Ace-2 receptor in other species is also providing clues about other animals that might be susceptible to the coronavirus. That knowledge will be crucial in future efforts to control the disease and prevent new strains, \n from triggering further outbreaks. \nIn the midst of the pandemic, the search for any potential treatments relied, for the most part, on repurposing existing drugs. By examining treatments that were already proven safe, and by looking at the way they worked, researchers had reason to believe they had a good chance of tackling Covid. With no specific treatments available and thousands of patients critically ill, this was emergency medical research. \nIn May, the UK launched \n, to test a group of existing treatments.\nThere have been mixed results, but in June, this trial provided a breakthrough - the first evidence that dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available steroid, could reduce deaths from Covid-19. Another trial being carried out in six countries, including the UK, recently revealed \n.\nIn the long term, many scientists think we face a world where the coronavirus is always present in the global population at some level. \"So we'll also need new drugs to target not only this virus, but other related viruses that could spill over in the same way,\" Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist from the University of Leeds, explains.\nOne line of attack that looks particularly promising is \n.\n\"The main aim every virus has when it enters a cell is to hijack it and use the machinery inside to copy itself thousands and millions of times over,\" explains Dr Griffin. To do this, the virus tricks the cell into making its own viral building blocks, or proteins.\nSome of the most important viral proteins are made as one, long chain - like a long roll of tape. So the virus also makes an enzyme called a protease that snips the sections of tape it needs to build functioning copies of itself.\n\"Protease is critical for the virus to thrive and drugs targeting it prevent some of the earliest stages of infection - stopping the virus from copying itself,\" Dr Griffin explains. Similar drugs are already successfully used against protease enzymes from HIV and hepatitis C.\nFor many countries in the northern hemisphere, outbreaks resurged through autumn and into winter. Scientists have, meanwhile, tracked the virus's every move and every mutation.\nBy taking a swab from an infected patient, the genetic code of the exact version of the virus that has infected them can be extracted, amplified and \"read\" using a sequencer, which is a machine that can translate biological code into a string of letters, or nucleotides. That allows whole genomes to be compared, so specific mutations can be spotted.\n\"There are also huge ongoing efforts to both track mutations and to assess their impact,\" Dr Lucy van Dorp from University College London (UCL) explains. It was \"thanks to these efforts, and to UK testing laboratories, that the recently discovered UK variant was flagged so quickly as a potential cause of concern\".\nViruses mutate all the time, as they make copies of themselves in millions of infected bodies. But understanding which versions of the virus are spreading most quickly - spotting patterns in that spread - has informed public health responses and transformed contact tracing.\nIn countries like New Zealand, where small, specific outbreaks have been found and brought under control, contract tracers can examine and compare genomes for clues. This is how so-called superspreading events are picked up - when a cluster of infections all share the same code.  \nResearchers have now sequenced more than 250,000 Sars-CoV-2 genomes, which have been shared on open data platforms like Next Strain. \"This is all going to feed into the vaccine design, as well,\" says Prof Eddie Holmes, the Sydney-based scientist who put the first viral genome online. The mRNA vaccines, in particular, are easily adaptable with a new set of genetic instructions.\nDespite being able to watch it spread and evolve almost in real time, researchers still have not pinned down where the virus came from.\nScientists agree that, like ebola, Mers and Sars1, the coronavirus originated in wildlife. But most experts also agree that the animal that the virus initially \"spilled over\" from was not in that Wuhan seafood market.  \nProf Holmes now thinks Wuhan was an \"amplification\" point for the virus, rather than being the origin. But there are different expert views on how the virus made the jump from bats to humans, and the lack of direct evidence currently makes solving that epidemiological puzzle almost impossible.\nChinese officials have concluded the outbreak is likely to have begun elsewhere, and that the crowded market simply helped spread the disease from person to person. \"It could have come from almost anywhere in China, quite frankly,\" says Prof Holmes, \"because Wuhan is a major travel hub.\"\nThat outstanding mystery made it all the more disappointing for infectious disease experts when China recently \n from those earliest cases. But connecting all the threads - from the earliest known cases of Covid all the way back to the original source of the outbreak - could take years, not weeks. \nWhile the coronavirus genetic code still cannot tell us exactly how the pandemic started, it does show that the virus came from bats. Genetically similar viruses - probable coronavirus ancestors - have been found in colonies of bats elsewhere in China. Emerging disease researchers agree that these animals were the likely original \"reservoir\" for the disease. But there is a gap - possibly of decades of viral mutation and evolution - between those bat viruses and the one that is now still wreaking havoc among humans.\nDr Polly Hayes from the University of Westminster explains that the coronavirus could have been initially harmless when it made the first jump into humans \"then... evolved to become harmful as it passed from person to person\".\nTo answer all of those remaining questions and to have a better chance of preventing the next pandemic, Prof Holmes stresses, channels of communication between scientists in every country must remain open.\n\"Politics can't come into it,\" he adds. \"Otherwise the world will be a far less safe place. I think preventing the next pandemic will be partly about fantastic, whizz-bang technology like genome sequencing and mRNA.\n\"But it's more importantly about people, scientists, talking to each other freely and openly.\""},

But it says the design has \"great potential\".\nOne day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet.\nIn traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky.\nUnder a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload.\nMaveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\"There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,\" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant.\n\"We believe that we have to go into a really\u2026 breakthrough technology,\" she says.\nAn equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.\nResearchers there are working on a design known as the \"Flying-V\". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350.\nLike Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves.\nThe designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be \"plugged\" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once.\n\"We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,\" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology.\nThe design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany.\nThe flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success.\nResearchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as \"Dutch roll\". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as \"a somewhat rough landing\" that damaged the front landing gear.\nData from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator.\nAirlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V.\nThe attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact.\nBut with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as \"showstoppers\".\nAmong them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency.\nThere's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the \"wing\" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal.\nBuilding a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region.\n\"That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,\" says Mr Wright.\nAirbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer.\nIts rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing.\nAircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier.\nBoeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design.\nBut current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at \n - are based on proving that concept.\nFor longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power.\nOne major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane.\nBut the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities.\nThose priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion.\nAirbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power.\nIn September, Airbus \n.\nHydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing.\nBut there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide.\nIn order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution.\n\"Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,\" he explains."},

For nearly five years, she willingly paid the city's premium rents and taxes, while commuting to work in another state.\nBut the pandemic wore her down.\n\"I was like, 'The city's going to come back. By July, it's going to be ok.' But it just kept not being ok,\" she says.\n\"I wasn't planning on leaving at all,\" she adds. \"It was a complete switch.\"\nSince March, property firms and moving companies have reported a rush of demand from people leaving New York, many of them young families, as the pandemic drives demand for bigger homes and more outdoor space, while making relocation easier by expanding remote work.\nAnd so far, the surge hasn't shown signs of slowing, says Liz Nunan, president of property firm Houlihan Lawrence, which handles home sales in suburbs around New York City, and reported its best year on record in 2020.\n\"One of the things I learned in 2020 is that I have no idea what the future holds, but I feel rather bullish on 2021,\" she says. \"I believe we'll have a year that's nearly as strong as 2020 turned out to be.\"\nLast year, longer distance relocations from New York City helped push New York the state to the biggest population decline of any in the US, putting it on track for its first population fall of any decade since the 1970s. \nThe signs of outflow have spawned a small universe of articles debating whether New York City is dead or dying, and what - if anything - should be done to help it recover. \nAnd as the US confronts an economic crisis likely to outlast the pandemic that precipitated it, such concerns are not unique to the US's largest city.\nSmaller downtowns across the country have watched in despair as signs of long-sought revival - new restaurants, businesses in formerly abandoned buildings - disappear almost overnight.\n\"This is a difficult time for everybody,\" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank. \"The real issue is: can these cities hold their economic vitality?\" \nIn New York, the pandemic has closed theatres, emptied offices, halted tourism, and turned shopping and dining into hazards to be undertaken at your own risk, gutting industries that employed a fifth of the city's workforce.\nAs many as a third of the city's small businesses may not survive the pandemic, according to estimates by local business group, the Partnership for New York City. Most companies in the city's downtown do not expect staff to ever return to the office in full force. Some firms have already left.\nThe situation has \n - almost double the national average - swollen the ranks of the homeless, and helped spur the departure of more than 300,000 people like Andrea, further straining public finances.\nIn response, New York leaders have raised the prospect of increasing taxes and cutting services like transportation, garbage collection and park maintenance, while begging for emergency aid from Washington to resolve financial woes - pleas that so far have fallen on deaf ears.\nMichael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at the free market Manhattan Institute think tank, worries the potential cuts will further accelerate the outflow, hurting the very amenities that make city life attractive and leaving a poorer city for those who remain.\n\"It's not really so much the pandemic that is the greatest challenge to New York City,\" he says. \"It's really the second order consequences that have dealt a blow to the city's recovery and its citizens.\n\"New York is not dead, but it is on life support,\" he says. \"Whether its recovery is measured in months or years or decades is primarily determined by the degree of leadership that we see in the city. And I think that's why we should be so concerned.\"\nIn some ways, such worries are uniquely American, reflecting the safety woes and weak educational systems that set so many US cities apart from counterparts in Europe and Canada, says Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto. He predicts that coronavirus outflow from cities outside the US will be less dramatic and more temporary.\nIn the US, however, the urban revival of the early 2000s had shown signs of fading even before the pandemic, as immigration waned and moves to the suburbs accelerated. \nIn New York, the population has been falling since 2016.\nThe expansion of remote work caused by the pandemic means the city is now competing with even more places for businesses and families - trends that are unlikely to fully reverse even after life returns to normal, Prof Florida says.\n\"Talented people have choice now with remote work. Those choices will be made carefully,\" he says. \"The big winners are places with a lot of amenity, and the premium for amenity will grow. That means cities with wonderful coast lines or rural areas near mountains. Places like Miami Beach, or Bozeman, Montana, or Aspen, Colorado, or the Hudson Valley of New York.\" \nAndrea, who initially decamped to her mother's home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says she hasn't entirely written off New York. But for now, she's planning a cross-country road trip, working remotely while scoping out new cities to potentially call home.  \n\"I'm going to hop in the car\u2026 and drive around the country, and see if anything feels like a fit,\" she says. \"If it doesn't, then I'll see where the world is in September.\"\nKevin Pearsall and his wife left New York City in March for Atlanta, Georgia. After years of focusing on their careers in advertising, the 35-year-old says they wanted a hometown where they didn't feel like housing and other living costs remained a stretch - even on their healthy six-figure salaries.\nThey both landed jobs as remote workers for New York firms - another sign that convinced them the city was no longer the only place they could combine professional opportunity and social life.\n\"All of the great things about New York - speakeasies, beer gardens... that's not really as unique as it used to be,\" he says.\n\"We were already in motion, thinking about leaving,\" he says. The pandemic \"just accelerated\" the move.\nNew York leaders have expressed confidence that the city will remain a draw, noting that outflow of a few hundred thousand hardly makes a dent in a city of more than eight million. \n\"I'm not going to beg people to stay,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last year. \"I know this city will rebound. I know it. And I know others will come. They have for generations.\" \n\"We can't overrate this moment in history,\" he added. \"It is a passing moment. There will be a vaccine. And then all the strengths of New York City will reassert again.\"\nHow it will shake out in the long term remains a question.\nThe neighbourhoods that emptied during lockdowns last year were the city's wealthiest, but a Manhattan Institute survey this summer found that \n with dissatisfaction highest among those with lower incomes.\nMr Hendrix says it is tempting to hope a more affordable city will emerge if the rich depart, but he worries such an exodus will generate still more challenges, given how dependent the city is on high earners for tax revenue.\n\"It doesn't take a majority leaving the city or a majority changing their lifestyle to make a big difference,\" he says.\n is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nProf Florida says the biggest cities, like New York and San Francisco, are likely to remain a draw for young people, who should benefit if rents continue to fall. \nBut he warns that such declines were short-lived after previous crises. And elsewhere in America, he expects downtown business districts - \n - to face major challenges.\n\"The central business districts - those places which packed and stacked knowledge workers in the vertical towers - they are in for a real reckoning,\" he says.

In this image, the oil paintings of political figures in the background emphasise this imagery of the past.\nThere have been renewed calls for the Confederate flag to be banned across the US following the anti-racism protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, a black man.\nHowever Mr Trump has defended use of the flag, calling it a matter of free speech.\nOne man in a Trump beanie here walks between the red guide ropes, as many visitors might do on a guided-tour to view the Crypt, the Statuary Hall and the Rotunda.\nBut this man is carrying a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, as he poses in front of a painting depicting the surrender of Gen Burgoyne in the war of independence. \nAnother man, identified as Jake Angeli, an ardent Trump supporter who has attended a number of the president's rallies, shouts as he makes his way to the Senate Chamber. \nHis incongruous garments set him apart from other protesters wearing black hoodies. These Trump activists stand by taking selfies, but he has clearly come here to be photographed by others.\nThe apparent lack of a security presence is in sharp contrast to other Washington protests where there is a highly visible presence of heavily armed security forces protecting US institutions.\nAnother Trump supporter, identified as Richard Barnett, sits with one boot disrespectfully on a desk that is at the very centre of power in Congress. It is in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \nIn the scene, unimaginable days earlier, Barnett in his baseball cap and checked shirt resembles a raconteur regaling friends with tales of his exploits. \nThe image went viral as did pictures of the notes he and others left on Ms Pelosi's desk.\nThis dramatic image shows how the formal proceedings came to a violent halt as Capitol police officers drew their guns on doors being attacked by protesters intent on entering the House Chamber.\nMany commentators asked if they were watching a coup unfold as doors were barricaded and firearms brandished.\nThe composition is reminiscent of a scene in a Hollywood Western, the lawmen bracing for the doors to be breached.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden made an impassioned TV address describing the scenes as \"an assault on democracy\" - this chilling picture encapsulates what he meant.

Mr Wolf last week called on Mr Trump to \"strongly condemn\" the protesters who stormed Congress.\nThe outgoing secretary said his departure had been prompted by \"recent events\", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment.\nLaw enforcement around the country are said to be bracing for the possibility of further violence in the days before Joe Biden takes office. \nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.   \n around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. \nCalls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots.\nLocal police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses following last week's violence, according to US media. \nThe Reuters news agency, citing a federal law enforcement official, said the FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. \nAlthough the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were reported elsewhere in the country at the same time.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday that it would begin National Special Security Event (NSSE) operations for the inauguration six days early, starting Wednesday.\nThe designation allows a wide range of security and law enforcement agencies to coordinate together on special protective measures, like enforcing road closures and a secure perimeter.\nThe announcement came after Washington DC's Mayor, Ms Bowser, went public with her appeal to bolster security after what she described as an \"unprecedented terrorist attack\" at the US Capitol last week.\nShe has also asked Americans to avoid travel to Washington DC for the event. Inaugurations traditionally draw hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital, but the coronavirus pandemic had already curtailed those plans before security fears were heightened. \nThe Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, said Monday that 10,000 troops will be in Washington DC by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested by local officials.\nElsewhere, the National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid \"credible threats\" of further violence.  \n\"Groups involved in the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol continue to threaten to disrupt the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20,\" the service said in a statement, adding it could institute further temporary closures to other areas within the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \nSpeaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was \"not afraid\" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears.\nHis inauguration committee has announced that the ceremony will be themed around \"America United\". \nAfter being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. \nDonald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years not to do so.\nThe warnings about further pro-Trump violence come as efforts move forward to impeach the president for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol.\nAn article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" during a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was \"stolen\" from him. \nDemocrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office.\nMr Trump has made no public statements since \n - on Friday.\nIt comes as websites and social media networks crackdown against other users and websites seen to be encouraging violence - including social network Parler, \n.

The 76-year-old faces 10 challengers, most notably the pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine. \nHuman rights groups have accused security forces of using excessive force to break up opposition rallies during the campaign. But the government says the strong measures are necessary to ensure people comply with a ban on large crowds imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nHere are the five things you need to know about the crucial vote:\nPresident Museveni is one of the longest-serving presidents in Africa. He and his National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986 at the end of a five-year war, and have led Uganda ever since.\nHis supporters praise him for bringing relative peace and prosperity to the country, and in particular for his policies on health. He helped limit the spread of HIV, and more recently his harsh lockdown - which closed schools and business, banned vehicle movement and imposed mandatory public mask use in May - is credited with tackling the coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to Johns Hopkins University, \n and around just 300 deaths from the illness.\nBut while he was once hailed in the West as one of the new generation of African leaders, his critics accuse him of turning into another authoritarian leader. \nMr Museveni has no designated successor within his party, and in 2017 \n allowing him to run again for the presidency. \nHe has seen off a number of challengers to his rule over the years, notably long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was arrested numerous times and decided not to run again for the presidency in 2021. \nWhile Mr Museveni maintains a large support base, especially in rural areas, he is facing increasing opposition over rising inequality and his rigid control over the country.\nOne of 10 candidates challenging him for the presidency this year is musician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known by the stage name Bobi Wine. \nAffectionately referred to as the \"ghetto president\", the 38-year-old became an East African musical superstar in the early 2000s before switching to politics and winning a seat in parliament in 2017.\nBobi Wine is seen as the biggest challenge to Mr Museveni's rule and has mobilised many young people who have not previously been involved in politics. He has sharply criticised the president in the past and accused him of \"fearing the people\".\nThe president has not taken this challenge lightly. He has accused Bobi Wine of being a foreign agent of those \"who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda\" and said that opposition figures are misleading young people to get involved in violence on the campaign trail. \nBobi Wine has been arrested several times since he became involved in politics. He has spoken of a \"revolution\" against Mr Museveni. \n using the hashtag \"WeAreRemovingADictator\".\nPart of Bobi Wine's popularity comes down to his age. At 38, he is just half as old as President Museveni, in one of the youngest nations on earth. \n Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide, of just 15.7 - only Niger is younger. \nThe \"ghetto president\" grew up in a slum in the capital, Kampala. His background and his efforts to promote social justice in his country through his music and as a politician have endeared him to this younger, more urban generation. \nBut Bobi Wine has also surprised authorities by drawing big crowds of supporters in rural areas - thought to be a bastion of support for President Museveni.\nTensions are high, and the campaign has been marred by serious violence, which has left dozens killed and hundreds more arrested. \nOfficials have cited measures brought in to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic for their efforts to break up political gatherings. But \n that security forces are using these regulations \"as a pretext to violate rights and clamp down on the opposition and the media\". \n for allegedly breaching Covid measures. His detention sparked protest which led to a wave of arrests and left dozens dead, mostly allegedly shot by the security forces.\nAfterwards, \n and said \"police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence\".\n\"Can I repeat? Police have a right to shoot you and you die for nothing.... do it at your own risk.\"\nBobi Wine has since taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest and helmet on the campaign trail. \nAt the end of last year he halted his campaign after a number of his team were injured as security forces dispersed one of his political rallies. He later told broadcaster CNN he had survived several assassination attempts. \nA country of more than 42 million people, Uganda is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nIt has one of the highest refugee populations worldwide, hosting \n from neighbouring countries. \nSome are watching the political unrest in the country with concern, and worry about what could happen after the vote. There has never been a peaceful transfer of power in Uganda and it is not clear what would happen if Mr Museveni were to lose, and what the military would do.\nThe president announced a shake-up of the armed forces in November, bringing in the former head of Uganda's operations in Somalia, Maj Gen Paul Lokech, as deputy inspector general of police to coordinate security forces around the capital during the election period. \nThe European Union has chosen not to send observers to the election this year - reportedly because \n to make polling more fair - meaning there will be less international scrutiny.

The opposition says this is because it is popular in those areas, but the government says the measure is due to Covid-19 restrictions. \n\"We found this network to be linked to the government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda,\" Facebook said in a statement. \n\"They used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were,\" the statement continued. \nBut government spokesman Ofwono Opondo hit back in a \n, accusing Facebook of failing to adhere to \"natural justice\" and echoing suggestions by other government figures that the social network is trying to influence the election outcome. \n\"We are not familiar with anybody who complains about these accounts,\" he said. \"The owners have not received any notice and no-one was asked to make any response to the allegations.\"\nMr Opondo described Facebook as high-handed. \"I think they are playing the usual games,\" he added. \"We know that they have a side in this election perhaps.\" \nThe government spokesman said Thursday's elections would be free and fair.\nThe BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that the campaign period has been dominated by social media, as political parties moved to reach a young, politically aware population.\nMany new accounts promoting messages from both the ruling party and the opposition have popped up in the last couple of months, especially on Facebook and Twitter. In many cases, the users did not use proper names, and shared content filled with hate messages and fake news, she says. \nUgandans online have said saying that the government has finally got a taste of what it feels like to be censured.\nIn December, the Uganda Communications Commission, the media industry regulator, wrote to Google, asking it to shut down several YouTube channels associated with Bobi Wine.\nIn the past, the government body has ordered online content creators such as influencers and bloggers to register and have their material vetted before publication, but this was put on hold after it was challenged in court. \nDuring the 2016 election, the government blocked social media on polling day and for several after, which led to the proliferation of VPN use in the country.\nIt feels like there is a fresh wind blowing through social media in terms of how it deals with political content.\nFirst we saw US President Donald Trump banned from Twitter and Facebook and now that has been extended beyond the US to Africa. \nFacebook has shut a slew of accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials, accusing them of \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\" in the public debate ahead of Thursday's election.\nMark Zuckerberg has long insisted that the platform he founded has to allow all forms of free speech and cannot become an arbiter of political conversations.\nSo what has changed? The truth is that the platform has increasingly focused on misinformation in recent years but the violence and chaos witnessed at the heart of the US government in recent days have forced it to speed up these attempts, and make some pretty big decisions.\nThe days of describing itself as a mere conduit for content seem to be well and truly over.\nIt has tried lots of ways to reduce misinformation, including ranking reliable journalism higher than fake news and training algorithms to identify \"bad\" posts, but it has had mixed results.\nBut now with all eyes on it, it is going to have to find a way to deal with content in a way that pleases politicians, its users and its advertisers, who do not want to be associated with a platform that is being accused of inciting unrest or influencing the results of elections.\nIt remains unclear how it will do so in the long term but in the short term expect more knee-jerk reactions to political events around the world.\nAnd the new look for the social network will come at a price.\nSome Ugandan officials are already accusing it of meddling in its election. Facebook could be stuck between a rock and a hard place for some time to come."},

So I lowered the prices, as it was more important to protect people than to think of profit,\" the 35-year-old tells the BBC.\n\"I had to increase my production by 75% to meet the demand when the pandemic started, so Covid-19 has been good for my business.\n\"But I made sure I gave free soap to vulnerable people such as the elderly and the disabled.\"\nMr Havyarimana's initiative has been praised by the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, which often highlights the contribution of refugee entrepreneurs to their host communities.\n\"The refugees are playing a pivotal role in helping contain the spread of Covid-19 in Kakuma,\" Eujin Byun, a spokesperson for UNHCR in Kenya tells the BBC.\n\"They helped in many ways, from disseminating information about the virus to helping people take the necessary measures.\"\nShe added that she was not surprised by Mr Havyarimana's decision to lower prices.\n\"Refugees are very community-oriented and they will look after each other. They have previously stepped up and helped us do our jobs in situations like that.\"\nMr Havyarimana currently employs 42 people in his business, named Glap Industries - short for God Loves All People. The bulk of the workers are refugees but 18 are Kenyans from the town of Kakuma.\nGlap supplies local businesses and institutions outside the camp and even relief agencies.\n\"The agencies buy my soaps to give away to refugees who cannot afford them and for their own staff too,\" the Burundian proudly notes. \nMr Havyarimana is not the only local soap merchant, but he does not fear the competition, and in fact offers classes to teach people how to make cleaning products.\n\"I want to mentor women and younger people so they can have an opportunity to become self-reliant and improve their lives like I did,\" he says.\n\"I want to help the community in any way I can.\" \nEfforts like his may have helped keep Covid-19 at bay in Kakuma. \nThe most recent UNHCR figures, dating from 24 December, show that there had been 341 confirmed cases with 19 people under medical care. There have been 10 deaths from the virus.\nKenya has registered nearly 100,000 cases nationally, with around 1,700 deaths, health ministry figures show.\nPolitical instability and violence have forced more than 300,000 people to flee Burundi to neighbouring African countries in the last decade, according to the UNHCR.\nMr Havyarimana was in the middle of his chemistry studies at the University of Burundi when he left. He says his life was in danger and that he was receiving death threats from relatives of his late mother, who also seized his home.\nAfter arriving in Kakuma, he wanted to make money for himself, rather than relying on humanitarian aid.\nThe camp sits in an isolated and arid region where the provision of basic services is a challenge for relief agencies. \nExploring the region, Mr Havyarimana noticed there was not a soap factory, which meant that cleaning products had to be brought from elsewhere.\n\"I had no idea of how to make soap, so I started surfing the web for some knowledge,\" he explains.\nHe later enrolled in a soap-making course offered by the World Lutheran Federation aid agency, and with a loan from a former classmate in Burundi, he started the business alongside two helpers.\nHe also received grants from relief agencies including the UNHCR and NGOs such as the African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC), which says it has supported more then 18,000 refugee entrepreneurs.\n\"Innocent's story shows how refugees can contribute to their host communities in a number of ways,\" Julienne Oyler, the AEC's chair, tells the BBC.\n\"Camps like Kakuma are so isolated that entrepreneurs like him are a lifeline to basic goods and services at a time of lockdowns and other restrictions.\"\nA 2018 World Bank study identified over 2,000 businesses in Kakuma and estimated that they contributed more than $50m (\u00a337m) to the local economy every year.\nMichelle Richey, a lecturer in technology and entrepreneurship at the UK's Loughborough University specialising in refugee business ventures, says people like Mr Havyarimana are very import in changing the general perception of refugees.\n\"The human potential within refugees shows when we give them chances to work instead of just focusing on humanitarian issues,\" she says.\n\"We can help those people have some control of their lives again after all they have been through.\"\nStarting a thriving business is not the only change in Mr Havyarimana's life since arriving in Kakuma. In 2017, he married Aline, a fellow Burundian refugee he met at the camp. \nThey have two sons, and the youngest one, Prince, was born in late November. \nMr Havyarimana speaks with fondness about life in Kenya but he dreams of being resettled in Australia or Canada. \n\"I like Kakuma a lot, but I want to give my wife and kids a better life,\" he says.\nIn the meantime, Mr Havyarimana is focusing on expanding his ways to help the community, and as well as offering 21 kinds of soap and cleaning products, he has devised a hand sanitiser created from aloe vera grown in a patch just outside his workshop.\n\"Coronavirus has affected the whole world but for us here in Kakuma, it has made it even more important that we clean our hands in any we can,\" he says."},

Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony.\nThis is the second time Democrats have pursued impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nIn December 2019, the House impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020.\nNo US president has ever been impeached twice.\nHowever, the prospect of an impeachment conviction is unlikely because of Mr Trump's broad Republican support in the Senate.\nThe resolution drafted by three Democrats - who began writing it while under lockdown in the Capitol last Wednesday - consists of one article: \"Incitement of insurrection\".\n\"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,\" the resolution reads.\nIn the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in \"imminent lawless action at the Capitol\".\nThe resolution also says this was \"consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct\" the certification of President-elect Biden's election win.\n\"He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,\" the resolution says.\nImpeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial.\nArticles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial to decide whether to convict or not. There is no appeal against outcome.\nAn impeachment is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nMr Trump was the third US president to be impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were also left in office by the Senate.\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached in 1974, as political pressure built over the Watergate scandal.\nOn Monday, the Democrats presented a resolution to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president and the cabinet to declare Mr Trump unfit for office.\nThe resolution urged Mr Pence to \"declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the president is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office\".\nBut, as expected, the resolution was not adopted by unanimous consent in the House, after Republican Alex Mooney of West Virginia objected to the request.\nThe House has now gone into recess until Tuesday morning, when the chamber is expected to vote on the resolution.\nAfter the vote, the Democrats said they will give Mr Pence 24 hours to remove Mr Trump from office before they move toward impeachment.\n\"The president's threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,\" Speaker Pelosi said.\nAlthough Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment.\nImpeachments are usually long, drawn-out affairs, involving investigations and hearings that can take weeks to conclude. This impeachment is expected to be much quicker. \nMonday's presentation of the impeachment article to the House paves the way for a vote to be held. A simple majority in favour of impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Senate.\nHowever, an internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires.\nThe Senate is currently not in session, and all 100 senators would have to agree to change the schedule, which is highly unlikely.\nConstitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial when Mr Trump leaves office. But Democrats appear confident that the House can impeach Mr Trump and send the articles to the Senate for a trial at a later date.\nOn Sunday, Democratic House whip James Clyburn said the party may not send any articles to the Senate for trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office.\nIt's a new week in Washington DC, but the fallout from Wednesday's tragic events are just beginning.  \nWith only eight days left of Mr Trump's presidency, Democrats are very aware of the disruption an impeachment and a Senate trial would cause to the early days of Mr Biden's administration.\nThat's why there is talk of delaying Mr Trump's Senate trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office. \nAt that point, the pressure to remove Mr Trump will be past, but other punishments - stripping him of the accommodations and privileges ex-presidents enjoy and prohibiting him from future federal office - still apply.\nA year ago, Senate Republicans voted as a block to acquit the president of impeachment charges. This time, however, there may be some willing to side with Democrats to make sure that Trump, once out of power, never returns again."},

He was later arrested by local police and the FBI for his role in the riots. \nFootage shows Mr Jensen leading the mob that chased Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts \"second floor!\" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber. \nAfter Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves Mr Jensen - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself, luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. \nThe image of Mr Goodman trailed by a mob - some armed with Confederate flags, others with allusions to the Nazi flag - was  extremely disturbing, Mr Burkhalter said. \n\"Police officer, not a police officer, to see a black man being chased by someone carrying a confederate flag - there is something wrong with that picture. That should never happen again,\" he said. \n\"It just reeks of everything we need to correct.\"  \nOfficer Goodman has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. \n\"As Trump's fascist mob ransacked the US Capitol, this brave USCP officer kept murderous rioters away from the Senate chamber and saved the lives of those inside,\" wrote congressman Bill Pascal on Twitter. \n\"Last Wednesday, I was inside the Senate chamber when Officer Eugene Goodman led an angry mob away from it at great personal risk. His quick thinking and decisive action that day likely saved lives, and we owe him a debt of gratitude,\" wrote Senator Bob Casey on Monday. \nMr Goodman's standoff with the mob came just minutes before authorities were able to seal the chamber, according to reporting from the Washington Post.\nMembers of the 2,000-person Capitol police department are tasked with protecting the Capitol building and those inside of it. They are separate from DC police, who patrol the rest of the city. \nThe chief of the Capitol Police Steven Sund resigned last week following criticism over his force's response to the riots, including a public call from top Democrat Nancy Pelosi for Mr Sund to step down. \nActing US Attorney Michael Sherwin has said that the Justice Department will consider pursuing criminal charges against any Capitol police officers found to be complicit with the rioters. \nOfficer Howard Liebengood, 51, who was on duty during the riots died by suicide on Saturday, his family has said. A lawyer for Mr Liebengood's family called the 15-year department veteran a \"devastating loss\". \nOn Twitter, Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he and his team were \"heartbroken\" over Mr Liebengood's death. \"Howie was a familiar and cheerful presence, and also a friend to me and my staff,\" Mr Romney wrote. \"His bravery, kindness, and genuine care for others was deeply felt by all of us who had the privilege of knowing him.\" \nAccording to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, the Capitol police force has responded to a number of incidents of officers threatening to harm themselves after last week's attacks. \nMr Burkhalter said that responsibility for any security breakdowns rests with the department's leadership. \nWhen you get to the place where individual police officers, like Officer Goodman, have to make decisions on the deployment of resources, the battle has been lost, he said. \"It should never have gotten to that point,\" he said.

There were 112 positive cases at the 66 EFL clubs in its most recent round of testing. \nThe Football Association will be reminding everyone of their responsibilities.\nIt is understood there are no plans to halt elite sport but government ministers are concerned that the images from dressing rooms could make it harder to defend its continuation. \nA Whitehall source confirmed to the BBC that the celebrations at Chorley and Crawley Town had been noted by ministers, who last week warned football's authorities they had to do all they could to justify elite sport carrying on.\nIn his letter written to clubs on Monday, seen by BBC Sport, EFL chief executive Birch also said: \"Throughout the pandemic, football has provided a glimmer of hope for many millions of people affected by restrictions but we all understand the scrutiny the game remains under.\n\"While football is permitted to continue the actions of all participants will clearly be under the microscope. \n\"I am therefore personally asking you to re-double your efforts, to check, amend and tighten your protocol accordingly, and ensure that players and staff are left in no doubt as to their responsibilities on matchdays.\"\nProfessor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told BBC Breakfast that allowing team sports to continue was \"a balancing act\".\n\"The balancing act is trying to minimise the amount of contact outside very structured environments while trying to keep some semblance of life as will all know it,\" he said.  \n\"It is very much a matter for individuals in their day-to-day life. We have all got to say what, in our own lives, can we do to minimise the amount of impact we have on the NHS and the vulnerable?\"\nElite sport is not quite in the last-chance saloon, but the exemption it has been granted, at a time when grassroots sport has had to stop, cannot be taken for granted. \nA suspension is not yet imminent, but there are also no guarantees, especially if infection rates continue to rise, hospitals become overwhelmed, and the national lockdown has to be strengthened further. The government's patience seems to be wearing thin after the scenes of crowded dressing-room celebrations made a mockery of the social-distancing protocols that clubs were reminded of. \nThe optics of on-field hugs and handshakes, and fans gathering outside grounds, beamed into millions of homes at a time when the government is desperate for the public to stay at home and avoid contact with other households, is highly unhelpful to those making the case for professional sport to be allowed to continue. \nMy understanding is that ministers and medical experts' concerns do not amount to a final warning; they realise that the coverage of elite sport encourages people to stay at home and helps to retain some normality and balance in people's lives, and that protocols have largely been successful in suppressing transmission around training and fixtures. \nBut having warned sports bodies of their responsibilities last week, the government does now expect to see the football authorities in particular redouble their efforts, and for players' behaviour to reflect the privilege they enjoy in being able to continue to work when there has been so much disruption in so many people's work and lives. \nCertainly, football can ill afford any more high-profile breaches of the guidelines by players when away from their clubs.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the rules around celebrations in particular could be \"difficult to understand\".\n\"To control emotions when you are playing at 200mph is very difficult,\" he said on Monday.\n\"We are asking our players at corners, for example, to be man-marking people, pushing people around and not fist-bump anyone.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola voiced similar concerns, saying: \"When one guy scores a goal, I don't know if they can be controlled and not celebrate it.\n\"The joy to celebrate it, I don't know if [a player] is going to think: 'I cannot hug my mate for two, three seconds'.\"\nWolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo described the increase of cases as \"scary\".\n\"What I'm afraid of is the decision to stop - football as we know now will not be the same,\" he said.\n\"This is my biggest fear because the schedule will go crazy.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said: \"Everyone knows the situation and if it gets suspended I don't think it'd be a surprise.\n\"We'll just go with what the Government and Premier League have to say and, if it's the case to carry on, we'll carry on. But I don't think I'm being controversial if I say I don't think anyone would be surprised if we don't carry on with the way it's sweeping through the country.\"\nDespite fans not being allowed to attend matches, football still allows for some sense of escapism - a point Arteta emphasised.\n\"We know what we can bring to society if we are able to do it in safe way,\" he said.\n\"There are a lot of positives to take but it is just that balance. When we are still safe, we can add something positive without this difficult context.\""},

But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents.\nDuring the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of him stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\" \nFor this revolutionary the harvest is still not over.\nMy introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out. \nThe piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings.\nIt is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity.\nHe is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure.\nMany young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language).\nBut the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around. \nIn his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the last election, he has been traversing the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets.\nAnd with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni has been keen to show his vitality. Last April, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November. \n\"If your father loves you, he has to empower you. In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern.\nThe economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power.\nOne of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty. \n\"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says.\n\"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent\u2026 he is an Africanist.\"\nNevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005.\nIndeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm.\nJournalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life.\n\"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote.\nBut something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits. \nHe had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age. \nAnd then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building. \nMany saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life.\nIt is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president. \nThe significance of patronage extends right through society.\nIt sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution.\nBut his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years.\n\"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council.\nWhile acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\".\nDespite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority.\nThe judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government. \nWhen judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.\nFor example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. \n\"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple.\nWhen it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment.\nThe media has also had its independence threatened.\nOn the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni. \n\"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala.\nBut outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds.\nBut perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered.\nAs it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents.\nKizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, once Mr Museveni's physician, first ran against him in the 2001 election. He has been detained and prosecuted on numerous charges, including rape and treason, but has never been convicted.\nNow that Bobi Wine, a singer whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is mounting a serious challenge to the president's rule, he has become the latest politician to face the wrath of the men in uniform.\nThe MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped. \nOn the campaign trail for this election, the police have arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups.\nDuring two days of protests in November following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces.\nSticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face.\nThrough his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control. He has also managed to reinvent himself. \nWhereas he was once the political upstart in his early 40s, anyone taking on that role now risks incurring his considerable wrath."},

{"title": "How Mexico is reclaiming spirulina", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20210111-how-mexico-is-reclaiming-spirulina", "tag": "travel", "tag2": "story", "author": "By Nicholas DeRenzo", "article_text": "\nIf you've spent any time dining in Mexico City recently, you may have noticed spirulina cropping up on menus in everything from the usual smoothies to more traditional dishes such as tortillas and \ntlayudas\n (a crisp tortilla base with refried beans and other toppings). But don't assume this is some symbol of encroaching hipster health food globalisation: in fact, centuries before it was deemed a \"superfood\", the vibrantly coloured cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae) \u2013 which grows primarily in warm alkaline lakes, ponds and rivers in the tropics and subtropics \u2013 was a pre-Hispanic dietary staple.\nThe Mexica \u2013 or Aztecs, as they were later known \u2013 harvested the protein-rich substance from the surface of Lake Texcoco, an expansive body of water in central Mexico that was later largely drained by the Spanish to make way for the construction of Mexico City. Here, the waters exhibited the perfect balance of salinity and alkalinity for spirulina to flourish. The Mexica called the foodstuff \ntecuitlatl\n, a Nahuatl word that roughly translates to \"rock excrement\", though they held it in decidedly higher esteem than its name suggests.\n\"Oral traditions say that the Mexica couriers and runners in ancient Tenochtitlan would eat dried spirulina cakes with corn, tortillas, beans, chillies or mole as fuel for long-distance travel,\" said Denise Vallejo, an indigenous first-generation Xicana chef who runs the vegan Los Angeles pop-up \nAlchemy Organica\n.\nEven without modern science, the Mexica could recognise the nutrient density that has made spirulina such a favourite today. It boasts about 60-70% protein by weight and has essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals, especially iron, manganese and B vitamins, according to the Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements. It's so healthy and relatively easy to grow, in fact, that \nexperts think it could be a potential food source for future Mars colonies\n.\nOf course, to the arriving Spanish conquistadors in the 16th Century, it mostly just looked odd. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo wrote in his 1568 memoir about \"a species of bread made of a kind of mud or slime collected from the surface of the lake, and eaten in that form, and has a similar taste to our cheese.\" And Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan included illustrations of spirulina harvesting in his 16th-Century ethnographic study, the Florentine Codex.\n\"After the Spanish invasion, most of its consumption declined with the draining of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico,\" Vallejo said. \"And many of the Spanish didn't enjoy its 'cheesy' or 'slimy' properties. Knowledge of its consumption was lost for a long time.\"\nThe Western world rediscovered the nutritious ingredient in the 1940s, when a French phycologist (a scientist who studies algae) noticed the Kanembu people along Africa's Lake Chad harvesting spirulina and turning it into sun-dried cakes called \ndih\u00e9\n. But it didn't make its grand return to Mexico until a happy accident in the 1960s, when the owners of Sosa Texcoco \u2013 which produced sodium carbonate and calcium chloride in a large snail-shaped pond on the remnants of Lake Texcoco \u2013 noticed a green substance mucking up the works. They reached out to French researchers, who concluded that it was the same organism that had been nourishing the Kanembu for generations. Rather than try to eradicate the cyanobacteria, Sosa Texcoco recognized its value, encouraged its growth and opened the world's first commercial spirulina company, Spirulina Mexicana.\nWhile Spirulina Mexicana has since closed, a micro-farm on the outskirts of San Miguel de Allende called \nSpirulina Viva\n is continuing the ancient tradition. Since 2010, American expat Katie Kohlstedt and her San Luis Potos\u00ed-born husband, Francisco Portillo, have grown fresh spirulina that probably tastes remarkably similar to what the Mexica harvested centuries ago. \"We're really proud to grow it here,\" she said. \"We didn't have to invent something new or bring something from somewhere else.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\n\u2022 \nMexico's ancient caviar\n\u2022 \nWhere there's no queso in quesadilla\n\u2022 \nMexico City's walking fish\nWhile many people may be familiar with spirulina in its dehydrated powdered form, Spirulina Viva sells the green stuff raw and frozen, which imparts a much more delicate flavour. \"Fresh spirulina should be creamy like a spreadable cheese,\" Kohlstedt said. \"If you closed your eyes, you might think you were eating a cross between an avocado and spinach.\" She noted that if you think of spirulina as fishy or an acquired taste, chances are you've been buying a lesser-quality product \u2013 or even one that uses ground fish bones to provide the phosphorus the spirulina needs to grow.\nKohlstedt and Portillo lead spirulina-growing workshops and have welcomed future farmers from as far away as Australia and Argentina. \"It's gardening combined with chemistry,\" Kohlstedt said of the process. But for many consumers, the finished product still remains a bit of a mystery. \"If I read one more article that said spirulina is grown in the ocean or [that shows] a picture of seaweed, I'm just going to scream,\" she said, with a laugh. \"My other two least favourite words are 'pond scum'. I think that's really offensive actually!\"\nKohlstedt recommends eating spirulina as simply as possible, stirred into warm miso soup or bone broth, blended into a smoothie, spread on bread or mixed into guacamole with extra lime juice, because vitamin C has been shown to help iron absorption. \"You're going to feel like you just ate Popeye's lunch,\" she said.\nIn Mexico City, chefs are getting even more creative with the ingredient. You might find spirulina dusting a tlayuda topped with avocado and \nescamoles \n(ant larvae) at \nBalc\u00f3n del Z\u00f3calo\n; brightening a superfood tortilla at \nCintli Tortilleria\n; adding a verdant punch to the smoothie bowls and cheesecakes at \nVegamo\n; and even spiking cocktails at the pre-Hispanic-inspired \nXam\na\nn Bar\n.\nThere, head bartender Kenneth Rodrigez has incorporated spirulina into a number of drinks, including a gin-based cocktail with Mexican lime and asparagus liqueur. \"I use it when somebody doesn't like egg whites or [in drinks for] vegan people, because spirulina has protein and we can get interesting textures,\" Rodrigez said, \"not to mention the incredible colour and the nutritional components that it provides.\"\u00a0\nHe describes the taste notes as \"green, herbal and \nclorofila \n(chlorophyll),\" and said that \"it can be used to enhance other flavours, because it has lots of minerals, like an alternative for salt.\"\u00a0\nAcross the border in Mexican American communities, using spirulina has meant establishing a direct connection with a pre-Hispanic past. At San Antonio's inventive Mexican restaurant \nMixtli\n, for instance, chefs Rico Torres and Diego Galicia featured spirulina on a special menu inspired by the Spanish conquest, and they participated in a collaborative D\u00eda de los Muertos dinner at New York's \nJames\nBeard House\n, where one of the hors d'oeuvres was a smoked spirulina yogurt with trout roe and radishes.\nAt Alchemy Organica, Vallejo incorporates spirulina powder into a pineapple \nagua fresca\n (a Mexican drink made with water, sugar and pureed fruits, seeds, flowers or grains for flavour) with lime and chia seeds. And she has even used it as \"a natural food colouring and nutritional boost, along with cactus and spinach powders\" to make vibrant green \nmasa\n (dough made with corn that has been nixtamalized, or treated with an alkaline solution), which she turns into colourful tortillas and tamales. \"I also use it as a flavour enhancer for some of my seafood-inspired dishes, as it imparts a flavour much like seaweed,\" she explained.\u00a0\nAnd when one of her cooks began selling fresh spirulina at a farmer's market, Vallejo took to simply scooping spoonfuls into her drinks. \"It gives you energy like you'd expect from a cup of coffee!\" she said.\nIn a sense, these chefs are tapping into something much deeper than simply taste or nutrition. Vallejo, who studies \ncuranderismo \n(folk medicine), said that spirulina is often viewed as a detoxifier to prepare for rituals, spells and \"visionary plant ceremonies\". And Kohlstedt has similarly heard about the ingredient's mystical connections, which draw on the similarities between spirulina's helical shape and our own building blocks as humans: \"Someone told me that the reason it's called 'spirulina' has to do with its spiral form, but that it also has to do with our DNA and how there is something really basic and spiritual about how we relate to plants [and cyanobacteria].\"\n\"So many of the 'superfoods' enjoyed today have a rich history in Mesoamerica: chia, amaranth, cacao, avocado, cactus,\" Vallejo noted. \"I think the current decolonising movement in Xicanx, Central American and other Spanish-speaking communities is helping us to rediscover and remember our ancestral foodways. We get to take back our foods and our plant wisdom.

It premiered on HBO in 1998 and ran for six seasons until 2004.\nThe show inspired two films, Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010.

Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it.\nBluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features.\nRaising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well.\nWi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in. \nConnecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers.\nUsing a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale.\nWorldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, \n.\nSmartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia.\nTaiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step.\nBut some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough.\nAs principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks.\nHe says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems. \n\"I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely.\"\nThere is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability. \n\"Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,\" he says.\nAnother challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi. \n\"Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,\" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks.\n\"The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,\" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly. \nOne solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection.\nIt can also be tricky to install smart locks.\nYale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws. \nHelpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky.\n\"I'm a bit of a door nerd now,\" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks.\nFor fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy. \nOne workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether. \nA server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. \"The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,\" she says. \nLock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens. \nSome want an \"active command and control experience\" using Siri or Alexa. \nBut others long for locks to \"do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,\" he says.\nIf we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in.\nThey can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.\nIf you, or someone you know, are affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) "},

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Atlanta and Feud: Bette and Joan. \nThe Sex Pistols electrified British music and, depending on who you believed, threatened the very fabric of society at the tail end of the 1970s. \nThey may only have survived for two years, but their angry, nihilistic singles and violent performances changed the idea of what rock and roll could be. \nOriginally formed in 1972 by Jones and drummer Paul Cook, they were galvanized by the addition of John Lydon - aka Johnny Rotten - whose abrasive vocals and anti-establishment lyrics defined the band and, to a large extent, the British punk movement.\nThey only released one album, but the sheer sonic force of songs like Anarchy In The UK, God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant became symbols of Britain's social and political turmoil, as youth unemployment soared, with young people particularly affected.\nNot that everyone was impressed by the Sex Pistols' curious combination of anger and apathy. \nTheir singles were blacklisted on the British charts and a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying their album cover. Facing bans across the UK, the group had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. - \"Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly\".\nAlways on the verge of chaos, they finally split up on a US tour in 1978. \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" a tired and disillusioned Johnny Rotten asked the audience at their final show - but their legacy was ensured.\n\"Imagine breaking into the world of The Crown and Downton Abbey with your mates and screaming your songs and your fury at all they represent,\" said Boyle, announcing his new project. \n\"This is the moment that British society and culture changed forever. It is the detonation point for British street culture... where ordinary young people had the stage and vented their fury and their fashion\u2026and everyone had to watch and listen\".\nThe series is based on Steve Jones's memoir, Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol; which doesn't just focus on his time with the band.\nIt begins in West London, where the young musician suffered maternal neglect and sexual abuse by a step-father, and quickly fell into crime - including an attempt to climb the chimneys of Battersea Power Station, and stealing amps from a David Bowie gig.\nAfter becoming entranced by the glam rock scene, he is taken under the wings of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who helped form, style and promote the Sex Pistols.\nThe book demystifies the band behind the myth - showing how they struggled with the criticisms lobbed their way and the pressure of living up to their image, including the moment Jones was goaded into swearing live on primetime TV.\nLater chapters deal with his battles with addiction, and his recent reinvention as a tee-total \"semi-retired sexual deviant who doesn't really act out so much any more\".\nBritish-born, Australian-raised actor Toby Wallace will play Jones, following eye-catching roles in the coming-of-age drama Babyteeth and Netflix drama The Society, where he played evil teen Campbell Elliot.\nAnson Boon, last seen in the Kate Winslet tear-jerker Blackbird takes on the spittle-flecked role of Johnny Rotten; while out-of-control bassist Sid Vicious will be played by Louis Partridge.\nSydney Chandler - daughter of film star Kyle - will become Pretenders star Chrissie Hynde, who had an affair with Jones at the height of the Sex Pistols' fame.\nThe Witcher's Emma Appleton is cast as Nancy Spungen, the American girlfriend of Sid Vicious, who died in mysterious circumstances in October 1978.\nAnd Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams plays \"the face of punk\", the iconoclastic model and actress Pamela Rooke, whose signature style - ripped fishnets, dominatrix heels and raccoon-like eye make-up - defined the scene.\nThe Sex Pistols project isn't the only musical series in the pipeline.

I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual.\nBut then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read. \nWith a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now.\nParler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too.\nTechnology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons.\n\"Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,\" she said.\nIt's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too.\nAgain, this is not unheard of. \nGab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days.\nWhat is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president.\nSince Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch.\nYouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance.\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as \"problematic\".\nEU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as \"the 9/11 moment of social media\", \n that \"the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing\".\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now \"taking editorial decisions\", adding that platforms were \"choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice\".\nElsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship.\nHe tweeted: \"The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship.\"\nThe fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter.\nOne of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse.\nPlatforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies.\nBut since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders.\nIn March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation.\nIt wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence.\nThe president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\".\nSocial media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets \"a pivotal precedent\" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post.\nSome analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide.\nOn Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election.\nPrivacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants. \n\"Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world. I think the president's removal might be the beginning of a purge for similar behaviour globally.\"\nIn his final hours on Twitter, Mr Trump once again blamed a piece of US legislation called Section 230 for \"banning\" free speech. During his presidency he threatened to repeal the law which makes social networks largely exempt from liability for their users' post.\nMany argue that removing the protection would actually harm free speech as networks would be forced to moderate far more than they currently do.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden has also stated that he would like to repeal the law to increase moderation and reduce the spread of fake news.\nIn the same final tweet Mr Trump said that he has been negotiating with \"various other sites\" and that there would be \"a big announcement soon\".\nIf the events of recent days are anything to go by, Mr Trump and some of his supporters face an uphill struggle against not just lawmakers but tech giants too before they can establish themselves on mainstream social media."},
{"title": "Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55575756", "tag": "news", "tag2": "N/A", "author": "N/A", "article_text": "\nMember states decide individually who to vaccinate, when and where, but the EU is coordinating strategy and buying vaccines in bulk. On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021.\nBBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch.\nThe fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation.\nA recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground.\nVaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than\nfirst doses had been administered. \nBut some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses.\nMuch of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order.\nGermany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. \nMr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand.\nGermany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer.\nThe Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager.\nBut the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. \"We believed when we contributed \u20ac12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,\" he told a newspaper this week.\nThe country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to \n people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. \nIt has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature.\nHowever, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer.\nFrance's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to \n - still so small as to be statistically meaningless.  \nSo why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used.\nThe primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. \nEach recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives.\nAnother problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers.\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings.\nPolitically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a \"state scandal\", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free.\nRussia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity.\nSputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded.\nA poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week that \n had been vaccinated.\nBut one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown.\nRussia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped.\nAlmost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is still \nof how many others have received the vaccination. \nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains \"feasible\". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. \nAlongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February.\nSwedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine.\nA successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. \nMeanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands.\nIt seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further \nelderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial.\nThe mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be \"seamless and fast\", tweeting: \"If that does not work, shoot me.\"\nThe first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September.\nYou may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed.\nAfter getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its \"careful\" approach.\nAnd there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. \nIn a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least.\nSpain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with \npeople vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. \nEach of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. \nGovernment data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. \nAlthough vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination.\nHowever, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. \nThe arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by \"political affiliations or parliamentary needs\", a claim the central government has rejected.

It looked very similar to Sars - the respiratory disease that caused a deadly outbreak in Asia in 2002.\n\"That was on 5 January,\" recalls Prof Holmes. \"And we just thought,oh no. It's Sars back again.\"\nBut this code - this virus - was different. It was new. Prof Zhang and Prof Holmes quickly submitted a paper describing what they had seen and, as the week wore on, a buzz of public health speculation about what the novel virus might be started on social media.\n\"I didn't sleep,\" Prof Holmes tells me. \"It was weighing on my conscience.\" In Sydney, it was early on 11 January when Prof Holmes phoned his colleague in China and asked his permission to publish the sequence. \"Zhang was on a plane, strapped into his seat,\" Prof Holmes recalled. \"He told me he needed to think about it - there was some pressure not to release too much information about the outbreak.\n\"He called me back about a minute later and said, 'OK, let's do it.'\"\nA researcher in Prof Zhang's lab emailed the genetic code to Eddie Holmes, who called a colleague in Edinburgh, in the UK. \"It was about 01:00 there,\" Prof Holmes recalls. \nIn the ensuing 52 minutes, the scientists together wrote a brief post explaining that they were \"releasing a coronavirus genome from a case of a respiratory disease from the Wuhan outbreak\" and uploaded the code. Their post said that researchers should please \"feel free to download, share, use and analyse this data\".\nWith that post, \n - the code that makes the coronavirus - was available to any scientist with an internet connection.\nIt set off 12 months of break-neck scientific endeavour. If you search the \n, you will retrieve more than 90,000 results. \n\"If we didn't collaborate with colleagues in China - if I wasn't working with and talking to Zhang - that sequence wouldn't have gone online as early as it did,\" says Prof Holmes.\nThat same weekend, scientists at a US pharmaceutical company called Moderna, which had never previously brought a product to market, downloaded the genome and started work on their experimental vaccine. Scientists at Pfizer did the same.\nThere are multiple methods - traditional and experimental - for making vaccines, but Moderna and Pfizer use an experimental approach based on something called mRNA (or Messenger ribonucleic acid). The terminology is a mouthful, but it describes a simpler, swifter approach to vaccine production. And it was boosted over the clinical finish line by the pandemic.   \nVaccination is fundamentally based on \"showing\" your immune system the disease-causing agent, so it can form a biological memory and be primed to fight it. For many existing virus vaccines, this has meant producing versions or pieces of the virus itself - often snippets of viral protein stripped of their disease-causing ability. These are grown inside chicken eggs, packaged up and injected.\n\"To grow enough of those things can take a very long time - sometimes years,\" explains Prof Robert Langer, one of the founders of Moderna, and a professor of chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US. \"With mRNA - you use the body as a factory to make that protein. So rather than have a giant plant with all these eggs to grow your proteins, you just make the mRNA, give it to the patient and the patient does everything else.\"\nMessenger RNA is a short sequence of coded genetic instructions for the protein you want a cell to make.\n\"I've been working on this technology for decades,\" says Prof Langer. \"This is actually the ninth mRNA vaccine that Moderna has developed.\" The others, which include vaccines that are designed to prime people's immune systems to fight their own cancer, are still in clinical trials.\n\"But when the pandemic hit, this technology lent itself to doing things as rapidly as possible.\"\nThere are now more than 150 coronavirus vaccines in some stage of development. But Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, which it developed in partnership with the German company BioNTech, was the first to receive emergency authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration. It was quickly followed by Moderna's vaccine - less than a year after scientists first downloaded the genome it was based on.\nIt was not until the end of January that the World Health Organization called the coronavirus outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern\". And it took until March for the WHO to officially declare a pandemic. Efforts to understand the virus - to find out where it came from, how to treat it and learn how it was evolving - were already moving almost as rapidly as the pandemic.\n\"With that genome, we didn't need the actual virus,\" explains Dr Dalan Bailey from the UK's Pirbright Institute. \"We could take that code and actually get the part of the virus that we wanted to study synthesised [using the genome as a blueprint] and have it in our lab within days.\n\"That definitely allowed us to start our research much more quickly.\"\nDr Bailey and his colleagues study how exactly the coronavirus latches on to and hijacks each cell. Key to this are those spikes we now see on every graphic depiction of the spherical coronavirus structure. Not only is the spike protein the key that unlocks viral entry into a cell, it is also the part of the virus that is most frequently recognised by our immune systems, so understanding its shape and its function is critical to optimising vaccines.  \nBy the end of March, with many European countries in lockdown, Chinese scientists had mapped \n.\nKnowing what the protein physically looks like means researchers can work out how antibodies bind to it. That is critical, because antibodies are the immune system's memory proteins. Immune cells produce antibodies to fit a specific invader - a virus that they have previously encountered in the form of a vaccine, perhaps. The antibodies then latch onto it and tag it for destruction. \"So this ultimately helps us design better vaccines,\" explained Dr Bailey.\nThroughout summer months in the northern hemisphere, lockdowns (temporarily and patchily) eased, but international tension did not. Even as US President Donald Trump sought to blame China for \"unleashing a plague\", scientists in the US and China carried on working together. By June, scientists from both countries had \n.\nPresident Jair Bolsanaro of Brazil, which remains one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, made baseless, very unscientific claims that Brazilians were somehow \"immune\" to the disease. Meanwhile, scientists there were \n amid a national funding crisis. \nOne large international effort, called the \n, saw investigators from research centres in Europe, Asia, and North America share data on how our own genes might affect how sick the coronavirus makes us.\nThere is no single, simple answer to the question of why some people have no symptoms at all, while others are made extremely ill by Covid-19. But many of these efforts to solve that puzzle have focused on the \"lock\" on our cells that the virus uses to gain access.\nIt is called the Ace-2 receptor. It is a biological lock that has evolved to be opened by chemical keys that occur naturally. That mechanism is fundamental to the biochemical machinery that is constantly whirring in healthy cells. Ace-2, for example, can be used as a cellular doorway by proteins that regulate our blood pressure. \nThe coronavirus, however, has cleverly (and unfortunately) evolved to fit that same lock.\nLike every building block of our bodies, the exact shape and function of our Ace-2 receptors is written in our genes, giving researchers valuable clues about who is most vulnerable to Covid-19.\nWhile there is no single coded clue to predict how sick we might be made by Covid, several studies of patients have spotted \n that might be linked with the severity of their illness.\nOne intriguing genetic study by German and Japanese scientists showed that a \n that the virus can use to hijack our cells.\nExamining the shape of the Ace-2 receptor in other species is also providing clues about other animals that might be susceptible to the coronavirus. That knowledge will be crucial in future efforts to control the disease and prevent new strains, \n from triggering further outbreaks. \nIn the midst of the pandemic, the search for any potential treatments relied, for the most part, on repurposing existing drugs. By examining treatments that were already proven safe, and by looking at the way they worked, researchers had reason to believe they had a good chance of tackling Covid. With no specific treatments available and thousands of patients critically ill, this was emergency medical research. \nIn May, the UK launched \n, to test a group of existing treatments.\nThere have been mixed results, but in June, this trial provided a breakthrough - the first evidence that dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available steroid, could reduce deaths from Covid-19. Another trial being carried out in six countries, including the UK, recently revealed \n.\nIn the long term, many scientists think we face a world where the coronavirus is always present in the global population at some level. \"So we'll also need new drugs to target not only this virus, but other related viruses that could spill over in the same way,\" Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist from the University of Leeds, explains.\nOne line of attack that looks particularly promising is \n.\n\"The main aim every virus has when it enters a cell is to hijack it and use the machinery inside to copy itself thousands and millions of times over,\" explains Dr Griffin. To do this, the virus tricks the cell into making its own viral building blocks, or proteins.\nSome of the most important viral proteins are made as one, long chain - like a long roll of tape. So the virus also makes an enzyme called a protease that snips the sections of tape it needs to build functioning copies of itself.\n\"Protease is critical for the virus to thrive and drugs targeting it prevent some of the earliest stages of infection - stopping the virus from copying itself,\" Dr Griffin explains. Similar drugs are already successfully used against protease enzymes from HIV and hepatitis C.\nFor many countries in the northern hemisphere, outbreaks resurged through autumn and into winter. Scientists have, meanwhile, tracked the virus's every move and every mutation.\nBy taking a swab from an infected patient, the genetic code of the exact version of the virus that has infected them can be extracted, amplified and \"read\" using a sequencer, which is a machine that can translate biological code into a string of letters, or nucleotides. That allows whole genomes to be compared, so specific mutations can be spotted.\n\"There are also huge ongoing efforts to both track mutations and to assess their impact,\" Dr Lucy van Dorp from University College London (UCL) explains. It was \"thanks to these efforts, and to UK testing laboratories, that the recently discovered UK variant was flagged so quickly as a potential cause of concern\".\nViruses mutate all the time, as they make copies of themselves in millions of infected bodies. But understanding which versions of the virus are spreading most quickly - spotting patterns in that spread - has informed public health responses and transformed contact tracing.\nIn countries like New Zealand, where small, specific outbreaks have been found and brought under control, contract tracers can examine and compare genomes for clues. This is how so-called superspreading events are picked up - when a cluster of infections all share the same code.  \nResearchers have now sequenced more than 250,000 Sars-CoV-2 genomes, which have been shared on open data platforms like Next Strain. \"This is all going to feed into the vaccine design, as well,\" says Prof Eddie Holmes, the Sydney-based scientist who put the first viral genome online. The mRNA vaccines, in particular, are easily adaptable with a new set of genetic instructions.\nDespite being able to watch it spread and evolve almost in real time, researchers still have not pinned down where the virus came from.\nScientists agree that, like ebola, Mers and Sars1, the coronavirus originated in wildlife. But most experts also agree that the animal that the virus initially \"spilled over\" from was not in that Wuhan seafood market.  \nProf Holmes now thinks Wuhan was an \"amplification\" point for the virus, rather than being the origin. But there are different expert views on how the virus made the jump from bats to humans, and the lack of direct evidence currently makes solving that epidemiological puzzle almost impossible.\nChinese officials have concluded the outbreak is likely to have begun elsewhere, and that the crowded market simply helped spread the disease from person to person. \"It could have come from almost anywhere in China, quite frankly,\" says Prof Holmes, \"because Wuhan is a major travel hub.\"\nThat outstanding mystery made it all the more disappointing for infectious disease experts when China recently \n from those earliest cases. But connecting all the threads - from the earliest known cases of Covid all the way back to the original source of the outbreak - could take years, not weeks. \nWhile the coronavirus genetic code still cannot tell us exactly how the pandemic started, it does show that the virus came from bats. Genetically similar viruses - probable coronavirus ancestors - have been found in colonies of bats elsewhere in China. Emerging disease researchers agree that these animals were the likely original \"reservoir\" for the disease. But there is a gap - possibly of decades of viral mutation and evolution - between those bat viruses and the one that is now still wreaking havoc among humans.\nDr Polly Hayes from the University of Westminster explains that the coronavirus could have been initially harmless when it made the first jump into humans \"then... evolved to become harmful as it passed from person to person\".\nTo answer all of those remaining questions and to have a better chance of preventing the next pandemic, Prof Holmes stresses, channels of communication between scientists in every country must remain open.\n\"Politics can't come into it,\" he adds. \"Otherwise the world will be a far less safe place. I think preventing the next pandemic will be partly about fantastic, whizz-bang technology like genome sequencing and mRNA.\n\"But it's more importantly about people, scientists, talking to each other freely and openly.\""},

But it says the design has \"great potential\".\nOne day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet.\nIn traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky.\nUnder a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload.\nMaveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\"There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,\" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant.\n\"We believe that we have to go into a really\u2026 breakthrough technology,\" she says.\nAn equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.\nResearchers there are working on a design known as the \"Flying-V\". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350.\nLike Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves.\nThe designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be \"plugged\" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once.\n\"We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,\" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology.\nThe design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany.\nThe flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success.\nResearchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as \"Dutch roll\". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as \"a somewhat rough landing\" that damaged the front landing gear.\nData from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator.\nAirlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V.\nThe attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact.\nBut with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as \"showstoppers\".\nAmong them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency.\nThere's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the \"wing\" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal.\nBuilding a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region.\n\"That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,\" says Mr Wright.\nAirbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer.\nIts rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing.\nAircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier.\nBoeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design.\nBut current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at \n - are based on proving that concept.\nFor longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power.\nOne major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane.\nBut the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities.\nThose priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion.\nAirbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power.\nIn September, Airbus \n.\nHydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing.\nBut there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide.\nIn order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution.\n\"Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,\" he explains."},

For nearly five years, she willingly paid the city's premium rents and taxes, while commuting to work in another state.\nBut the pandemic wore her down.\n\"I was like, 'The city's going to come back. By July, it's going to be ok.' But it just kept not being ok,\" she says.\n\"I wasn't planning on leaving at all,\" she adds. \"It was a complete switch.\"\nSince March, property firms and moving companies have reported a rush of demand from people leaving New York, many of them young families, as the pandemic drives demand for bigger homes and more outdoor space, while making relocation easier by expanding remote work.\nAnd so far, the surge hasn't shown signs of slowing, says Liz Nunan, president of property firm Houlihan Lawrence, which handles home sales in suburbs around New York City, and reported its best year on record in 2020.\n\"One of the things I learned in 2020 is that I have no idea what the future holds, but I feel rather bullish on 2021,\" she says. \"I believe we'll have a year that's nearly as strong as 2020 turned out to be.\"\nLast year, longer distance relocations from New York City helped push New York the state to the biggest population decline of any in the US, putting it on track for its first population fall of any decade since the 1970s. \nThe signs of outflow have spawned a small universe of articles debating whether New York City is dead or dying, and what - if anything - should be done to help it recover. \nAnd as the US confronts an economic crisis likely to outlast the pandemic that precipitated it, such concerns are not unique to the US's largest city.\nSmaller downtowns across the country have watched in despair as signs of long-sought revival - new restaurants, businesses in formerly abandoned buildings - disappear almost overnight.\n\"This is a difficult time for everybody,\" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank. \"The real issue is: can these cities hold their economic vitality?\" \nIn New York, the pandemic has closed theatres, emptied offices, halted tourism, and turned shopping and dining into hazards to be undertaken at your own risk, gutting industries that employed a fifth of the city's workforce.\nAs many as a third of the city's small businesses may not survive the pandemic, according to estimates by local business group, the Partnership for New York City. Most companies in the city's downtown do not expect staff to ever return to the office in full force. Some firms have already left.\nThe situation has \n - almost double the national average - swollen the ranks of the homeless, and helped spur the departure of more than 300,000 people like Andrea, further straining public finances.\nIn response, New York leaders have raised the prospect of increasing taxes and cutting services like transportation, garbage collection and park maintenance, while begging for emergency aid from Washington to resolve financial woes - pleas that so far have fallen on deaf ears.\nMichael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at the free market Manhattan Institute think tank, worries the potential cuts will further accelerate the outflow, hurting the very amenities that make city life attractive and leaving a poorer city for those who remain.\n\"It's not really so much the pandemic that is the greatest challenge to New York City,\" he says. \"It's really the second order consequences that have dealt a blow to the city's recovery and its citizens.\n\"New York is not dead, but it is on life support,\" he says. \"Whether its recovery is measured in months or years or decades is primarily determined by the degree of leadership that we see in the city. And I think that's why we should be so concerned.\"\nIn some ways, such worries are uniquely American, reflecting the safety woes and weak educational systems that set so many US cities apart from counterparts in Europe and Canada, says Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto. He predicts that coronavirus outflow from cities outside the US will be less dramatic and more temporary.\nIn the US, however, the urban revival of the early 2000s had shown signs of fading even before the pandemic, as immigration waned and moves to the suburbs accelerated. \nIn New York, the population has been falling since 2016.\nThe expansion of remote work caused by the pandemic means the city is now competing with even more places for businesses and families - trends that are unlikely to fully reverse even after life returns to normal, Prof Florida says.\n\"Talented people have choice now with remote work. Those choices will be made carefully,\" he says. \"The big winners are places with a lot of amenity, and the premium for amenity will grow. That means cities with wonderful coast lines or rural areas near mountains. Places like Miami Beach, or Bozeman, Montana, or Aspen, Colorado, or the Hudson Valley of New York.\" \nAndrea, who initially decamped to her mother's home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says she hasn't entirely written off New York. But for now, she's planning a cross-country road trip, working remotely while scoping out new cities to potentially call home.  \n\"I'm going to hop in the car\u2026 and drive around the country, and see if anything feels like a fit,\" she says. \"If it doesn't, then I'll see where the world is in September.\"\nKevin Pearsall and his wife left New York City in March for Atlanta, Georgia. After years of focusing on their careers in advertising, the 35-year-old says they wanted a hometown where they didn't feel like housing and other living costs remained a stretch - even on their healthy six-figure salaries.\nThey both landed jobs as remote workers for New York firms - another sign that convinced them the city was no longer the only place they could combine professional opportunity and social life.\n\"All of the great things about New York - speakeasies, beer gardens... that's not really as unique as it used to be,\" he says.\n\"We were already in motion, thinking about leaving,\" he says. The pandemic \"just accelerated\" the move.\nNew York leaders have expressed confidence that the city will remain a draw, noting that outflow of a few hundred thousand hardly makes a dent in a city of more than eight million. \n\"I'm not going to beg people to stay,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last year. \"I know this city will rebound. I know it. And I know others will come. They have for generations.\" \n\"We can't overrate this moment in history,\" he added. \"It is a passing moment. There will be a vaccine. And then all the strengths of New York City will reassert again.\"\nHow it will shake out in the long term remains a question.\nThe neighbourhoods that emptied during lockdowns last year were the city's wealthiest, but a Manhattan Institute survey this summer found that \n with dissatisfaction highest among those with lower incomes.\nMr Hendrix says it is tempting to hope a more affordable city will emerge if the rich depart, but he worries such an exodus will generate still more challenges, given how dependent the city is on high earners for tax revenue.\n\"It doesn't take a majority leaving the city or a majority changing their lifestyle to make a big difference,\" he says.\n is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nProf Florida says the biggest cities, like New York and San Francisco, are likely to remain a draw for young people, who should benefit if rents continue to fall. \nBut he warns that such declines were short-lived after previous crises. And elsewhere in America, he expects downtown business districts - \n - to face major challenges.\n\"The central business districts - those places which packed and stacked knowledge workers in the vertical towers - they are in for a real reckoning,\" he says.

In this image, the oil paintings of political figures in the background emphasise this imagery of the past.\nThere have been renewed calls for the Confederate flag to be banned across the US following the anti-racism protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, a black man.\nHowever Mr Trump has defended use of the flag, calling it a matter of free speech.\nOne man in a Trump beanie here walks between the red guide ropes, as many visitors might do on a guided-tour to view the Crypt, the Statuary Hall and the Rotunda.\nBut this man is carrying a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, as he poses in front of a painting depicting the surrender of Gen Burgoyne in the war of independence. \nAnother man, identified as Jake Angeli, an ardent Trump supporter who has attended a number of the president's rallies, shouts as he makes his way to the Senate Chamber. \nHis incongruous garments set him apart from other protesters wearing black hoodies. These Trump activists stand by taking selfies, but he has clearly come here to be photographed by others.\nThe apparent lack of a security presence is in sharp contrast to other Washington protests where there is a highly visible presence of heavily armed security forces protecting US institutions.\nAnother Trump supporter, identified as Richard Barnett, sits with one boot disrespectfully on a desk that is at the very centre of power in Congress. It is in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \nIn the scene, unimaginable days earlier, Barnett in his baseball cap and checked shirt resembles a raconteur regaling friends with tales of his exploits. \nThe image went viral as did pictures of the notes he and others left on Ms Pelosi's desk.\nThis dramatic image shows how the formal proceedings came to a violent halt as Capitol police officers drew their guns on doors being attacked by protesters intent on entering the House Chamber.\nMany commentators asked if they were watching a coup unfold as doors were barricaded and firearms brandished.\nThe composition is reminiscent of a scene in a Hollywood Western, the lawmen bracing for the doors to be breached.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden made an impassioned TV address describing the scenes as \"an assault on democracy\" - this chilling picture encapsulates what he meant.

Mr Wolf last week called on Mr Trump to \"strongly condemn\" the protesters who stormed Congress.\nThe outgoing secretary said his departure had been prompted by \"recent events\", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment.\nLaw enforcement around the country are said to be bracing for the possibility of further violence in the days before Joe Biden takes office. \nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.   \n around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. \nCalls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots.\nLocal police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses following last week's violence, according to US media. \nThe Reuters news agency, citing a federal law enforcement official, said the FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. \nAlthough the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were reported elsewhere in the country at the same time.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday that it would begin National Special Security Event (NSSE) operations for the inauguration six days early, starting Wednesday.\nThe designation allows a wide range of security and law enforcement agencies to coordinate together on special protective measures, like enforcing road closures and a secure perimeter.\nThe announcement came after Washington DC's Mayor, Ms Bowser, went public with her appeal to bolster security after what she described as an \"unprecedented terrorist attack\" at the US Capitol last week.\nShe has also asked Americans to avoid travel to Washington DC for the event. Inaugurations traditionally draw hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital, but the coronavirus pandemic had already curtailed those plans before security fears were heightened. \nThe Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, said Monday that 10,000 troops will be in Washington DC by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested by local officials.\nElsewhere, the National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid \"credible threats\" of further violence.  \n\"Groups involved in the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol continue to threaten to disrupt the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20,\" the service said in a statement, adding it could institute further temporary closures to other areas within the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \nSpeaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was \"not afraid\" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears.\nHis inauguration committee has announced that the ceremony will be themed around \"America United\". \nAfter being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. \nDonald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years not to do so.\nThe warnings about further pro-Trump violence come as efforts move forward to impeach the president for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol.\nAn article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" during a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was \"stolen\" from him. \nDemocrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office.\nMr Trump has made no public statements since \n - on Friday.\nIt comes as websites and social media networks crackdown against other users and websites seen to be encouraging violence - including social network Parler, \n.

The 76-year-old faces 10 challengers, most notably the pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine. \nHuman rights groups have accused security forces of using excessive force to break up opposition rallies during the campaign. But the government says the strong measures are necessary to ensure people comply with a ban on large crowds imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nHere are the five things you need to know about the crucial vote:\nPresident Museveni is one of the longest-serving presidents in Africa. He and his National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986 at the end of a five-year war, and have led Uganda ever since.\nHis supporters praise him for bringing relative peace and prosperity to the country, and in particular for his policies on health. He helped limit the spread of HIV, and more recently his harsh lockdown - which closed schools and business, banned vehicle movement and imposed mandatory public mask use in May - is credited with tackling the coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to Johns Hopkins University, \n and around just 300 deaths from the illness.\nBut while he was once hailed in the West as one of the new generation of African leaders, his critics accuse him of turning into another authoritarian leader. \nMr Museveni has no designated successor within his party, and in 2017 \n allowing him to run again for the presidency. \nHe has seen off a number of challengers to his rule over the years, notably long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was arrested numerous times and decided not to run again for the presidency in 2021. \nWhile Mr Museveni maintains a large support base, especially in rural areas, he is facing increasing opposition over rising inequality and his rigid control over the country.\nOne of 10 candidates challenging him for the presidency this year is musician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known by the stage name Bobi Wine. \nAffectionately referred to as the \"ghetto president\", the 38-year-old became an East African musical superstar in the early 2000s before switching to politics and winning a seat in parliament in 2017.\nBobi Wine is seen as the biggest challenge to Mr Museveni's rule and has mobilised many young people who have not previously been involved in politics. He has sharply criticised the president in the past and accused him of \"fearing the people\".\nThe president has not taken this challenge lightly. He has accused Bobi Wine of being a foreign agent of those \"who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda\" and said that opposition figures are misleading young people to get involved in violence on the campaign trail. \nBobi Wine has been arrested several times since he became involved in politics. He has spoken of a \"revolution\" against Mr Museveni. \n using the hashtag \"WeAreRemovingADictator\".\nPart of Bobi Wine's popularity comes down to his age. At 38, he is just half as old as President Museveni, in one of the youngest nations on earth. \n Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide, of just 15.7 - only Niger is younger. \nThe \"ghetto president\" grew up in a slum in the capital, Kampala. His background and his efforts to promote social justice in his country through his music and as a politician have endeared him to this younger, more urban generation. \nBut Bobi Wine has also surprised authorities by drawing big crowds of supporters in rural areas - thought to be a bastion of support for President Museveni.\nTensions are high, and the campaign has been marred by serious violence, which has left dozens killed and hundreds more arrested. \nOfficials have cited measures brought in to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic for their efforts to break up political gatherings. But \n that security forces are using these regulations \"as a pretext to violate rights and clamp down on the opposition and the media\". \n for allegedly breaching Covid measures. His detention sparked protest which led to a wave of arrests and left dozens dead, mostly allegedly shot by the security forces.\nAfterwards, \n and said \"police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence\".\n\"Can I repeat? Police have a right to shoot you and you die for nothing.... do it at your own risk.\"\nBobi Wine has since taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest and helmet on the campaign trail. \nAt the end of last year he halted his campaign after a number of his team were injured as security forces dispersed one of his political rallies. He later told broadcaster CNN he had survived several assassination attempts. \nA country of more than 42 million people, Uganda is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nIt has one of the highest refugee populations worldwide, hosting \n from neighbouring countries. \nSome are watching the political unrest in the country with concern, and worry about what could happen after the vote. There has never been a peaceful transfer of power in Uganda and it is not clear what would happen if Mr Museveni were to lose, and what the military would do.\nThe president announced a shake-up of the armed forces in November, bringing in the former head of Uganda's operations in Somalia, Maj Gen Paul Lokech, as deputy inspector general of police to coordinate security forces around the capital during the election period. \nThe European Union has chosen not to send observers to the election this year - reportedly because \n to make polling more fair - meaning there will be less international scrutiny.

The opposition says this is because it is popular in those areas, but the government says the measure is due to Covid-19 restrictions. \n\"We found this network to be linked to the government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda,\" Facebook said in a statement. \n\"They used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were,\" the statement continued. \nBut government spokesman Ofwono Opondo hit back in a \n, accusing Facebook of failing to adhere to \"natural justice\" and echoing suggestions by other government figures that the social network is trying to influence the election outcome. \n\"We are not familiar with anybody who complains about these accounts,\" he said. \"The owners have not received any notice and no-one was asked to make any response to the allegations.\"\nMr Opondo described Facebook as high-handed. \"I think they are playing the usual games,\" he added. \"We know that they have a side in this election perhaps.\" \nThe government spokesman said Thursday's elections would be free and fair.\nThe BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that the campaign period has been dominated by social media, as political parties moved to reach a young, politically aware population.\nMany new accounts promoting messages from both the ruling party and the opposition have popped up in the last couple of months, especially on Facebook and Twitter. In many cases, the users did not use proper names, and shared content filled with hate messages and fake news, she says. \nUgandans online have said saying that the government has finally got a taste of what it feels like to be censured.\nIn December, the Uganda Communications Commission, the media industry regulator, wrote to Google, asking it to shut down several YouTube channels associated with Bobi Wine.\nIn the past, the government body has ordered online content creators such as influencers and bloggers to register and have their material vetted before publication, but this was put on hold after it was challenged in court. \nDuring the 2016 election, the government blocked social media on polling day and for several after, which led to the proliferation of VPN use in the country.\nIt feels like there is a fresh wind blowing through social media in terms of how it deals with political content.\nFirst we saw US President Donald Trump banned from Twitter and Facebook and now that has been extended beyond the US to Africa. \nFacebook has shut a slew of accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials, accusing them of \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\" in the public debate ahead of Thursday's election.\nMark Zuckerberg has long insisted that the platform he founded has to allow all forms of free speech and cannot become an arbiter of political conversations.\nSo what has changed? The truth is that the platform has increasingly focused on misinformation in recent years but the violence and chaos witnessed at the heart of the US government in recent days have forced it to speed up these attempts, and make some pretty big decisions.\nThe days of describing itself as a mere conduit for content seem to be well and truly over.\nIt has tried lots of ways to reduce misinformation, including ranking reliable journalism higher than fake news and training algorithms to identify \"bad\" posts, but it has had mixed results.\nBut now with all eyes on it, it is going to have to find a way to deal with content in a way that pleases politicians, its users and its advertisers, who do not want to be associated with a platform that is being accused of inciting unrest or influencing the results of elections.\nIt remains unclear how it will do so in the long term but in the short term expect more knee-jerk reactions to political events around the world.\nAnd the new look for the social network will come at a price.\nSome Ugandan officials are already accusing it of meddling in its election. Facebook could be stuck between a rock and a hard place for some time to come."},

So I lowered the prices, as it was more important to protect people than to think of profit,\" the 35-year-old tells the BBC.\n\"I had to increase my production by 75% to meet the demand when the pandemic started, so Covid-19 has been good for my business.\n\"But I made sure I gave free soap to vulnerable people such as the elderly and the disabled.\"\nMr Havyarimana's initiative has been praised by the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, which often highlights the contribution of refugee entrepreneurs to their host communities.\n\"The refugees are playing a pivotal role in helping contain the spread of Covid-19 in Kakuma,\" Eujin Byun, a spokesperson for UNHCR in Kenya tells the BBC.\n\"They helped in many ways, from disseminating information about the virus to helping people take the necessary measures.\"\nShe added that she was not surprised by Mr Havyarimana's decision to lower prices.\n\"Refugees are very community-oriented and they will look after each other. They have previously stepped up and helped us do our jobs in situations like that.\"\nMr Havyarimana currently employs 42 people in his business, named Glap Industries - short for God Loves All People. The bulk of the workers are refugees but 18 are Kenyans from the town of Kakuma.\nGlap supplies local businesses and institutions outside the camp and even relief agencies.\n\"The agencies buy my soaps to give away to refugees who cannot afford them and for their own staff too,\" the Burundian proudly notes. \nMr Havyarimana is not the only local soap merchant, but he does not fear the competition, and in fact offers classes to teach people how to make cleaning products.\n\"I want to mentor women and younger people so they can have an opportunity to become self-reliant and improve their lives like I did,\" he says.\n\"I want to help the community in any way I can.\" \nEfforts like his may have helped keep Covid-19 at bay in Kakuma. \nThe most recent UNHCR figures, dating from 24 December, show that there had been 341 confirmed cases with 19 people under medical care. There have been 10 deaths from the virus.\nKenya has registered nearly 100,000 cases nationally, with around 1,700 deaths, health ministry figures show.\nPolitical instability and violence have forced more than 300,000 people to flee Burundi to neighbouring African countries in the last decade, according to the UNHCR.\nMr Havyarimana was in the middle of his chemistry studies at the University of Burundi when he left. He says his life was in danger and that he was receiving death threats from relatives of his late mother, who also seized his home.\nAfter arriving in Kakuma, he wanted to make money for himself, rather than relying on humanitarian aid.\nThe camp sits in an isolated and arid region where the provision of basic services is a challenge for relief agencies. \nExploring the region, Mr Havyarimana noticed there was not a soap factory, which meant that cleaning products had to be brought from elsewhere.\n\"I had no idea of how to make soap, so I started surfing the web for some knowledge,\" he explains.\nHe later enrolled in a soap-making course offered by the World Lutheran Federation aid agency, and with a loan from a former classmate in Burundi, he started the business alongside two helpers.\nHe also received grants from relief agencies including the UNHCR and NGOs such as the African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC), which says it has supported more then 18,000 refugee entrepreneurs.\n\"Innocent's story shows how refugees can contribute to their host communities in a number of ways,\" Julienne Oyler, the AEC's chair, tells the BBC.\n\"Camps like Kakuma are so isolated that entrepreneurs like him are a lifeline to basic goods and services at a time of lockdowns and other restrictions.\"\nA 2018 World Bank study identified over 2,000 businesses in Kakuma and estimated that they contributed more than $50m (\u00a337m) to the local economy every year.\nMichelle Richey, a lecturer in technology and entrepreneurship at the UK's Loughborough University specialising in refugee business ventures, says people like Mr Havyarimana are very import in changing the general perception of refugees.\n\"The human potential within refugees shows when we give them chances to work instead of just focusing on humanitarian issues,\" she says.\n\"We can help those people have some control of their lives again after all they have been through.\"\nStarting a thriving business is not the only change in Mr Havyarimana's life since arriving in Kakuma. In 2017, he married Aline, a fellow Burundian refugee he met at the camp. \nThey have two sons, and the youngest one, Prince, was born in late November. \nMr Havyarimana speaks with fondness about life in Kenya but he dreams of being resettled in Australia or Canada. \n\"I like Kakuma a lot, but I want to give my wife and kids a better life,\" he says.\nIn the meantime, Mr Havyarimana is focusing on expanding his ways to help the community, and as well as offering 21 kinds of soap and cleaning products, he has devised a hand sanitiser created from aloe vera grown in a patch just outside his workshop.\n\"Coronavirus has affected the whole world but for us here in Kakuma, it has made it even more important that we clean our hands in any we can,\" he says."},

Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony.\nThis is the second time Democrats have pursued impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nIn December 2019, the House impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020.\nNo US president has ever been impeached twice.\nHowever, the prospect of an impeachment conviction is unlikely because of Mr Trump's broad Republican support in the Senate.\nThe resolution drafted by three Democrats - who began writing it while under lockdown in the Capitol last Wednesday - consists of one article: \"Incitement of insurrection\".\n\"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,\" the resolution reads.\nIn the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in \"imminent lawless action at the Capitol\".\nThe resolution also says this was \"consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct\" the certification of President-elect Biden's election win.\n\"He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,\" the resolution says.\nImpeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial.\nArticles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial to decide whether to convict or not. There is no appeal against outcome.\nAn impeachment is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nMr Trump was the third US president to be impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were also left in office by the Senate.\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached in 1974, as political pressure built over the Watergate scandal.\nOn Monday, the Democrats presented a resolution to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president and the cabinet to declare Mr Trump unfit for office.\nThe resolution urged Mr Pence to \"declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the president is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office\".\nBut, as expected, the resolution was not adopted by unanimous consent in the House, after Republican Alex Mooney of West Virginia objected to the request.\nThe House has now gone into recess until Tuesday morning, when the chamber is expected to vote on the resolution.\nAfter the vote, the Democrats said they will give Mr Pence 24 hours to remove Mr Trump from office before they move toward impeachment.\n\"The president's threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,\" Speaker Pelosi said.\nAlthough Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment.\nImpeachments are usually long, drawn-out affairs, involving investigations and hearings that can take weeks to conclude. This impeachment is expected to be much quicker. \nMonday's presentation of the impeachment article to the House paves the way for a vote to be held. A simple majority in favour of impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Senate.\nHowever, an internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires.\nThe Senate is currently not in session, and all 100 senators would have to agree to change the schedule, which is highly unlikely.\nConstitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial when Mr Trump leaves office. But Democrats appear confident that the House can impeach Mr Trump and send the articles to the Senate for a trial at a later date.\nOn Sunday, Democratic House whip James Clyburn said the party may not send any articles to the Senate for trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office.\nIt's a new week in Washington DC, but the fallout from Wednesday's tragic events are just beginning.  \nWith only eight days left of Mr Trump's presidency, Democrats are very aware of the disruption an impeachment and a Senate trial would cause to the early days of Mr Biden's administration.\nThat's why there is talk of delaying Mr Trump's Senate trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office. \nAt that point, the pressure to remove Mr Trump will be past, but other punishments - stripping him of the accommodations and privileges ex-presidents enjoy and prohibiting him from future federal office - still apply.\nA year ago, Senate Republicans voted as a block to acquit the president of impeachment charges. This time, however, there may be some willing to side with Democrats to make sure that Trump, once out of power, never returns again."},

He was later arrested by local police and the FBI for his role in the riots. \nFootage shows Mr Jensen leading the mob that chased Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts \"second floor!\" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber. \nAfter Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves Mr Jensen - a move seemingly designed to draw attention onto himself, luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. \nThe image of Mr Goodman trailed by a mob - some armed with Confederate flags, others with allusions to the Nazi flag - was  extremely disturbing, Mr Burkhalter said. \n\"Police officer, not a police officer, to see a black man being chased by someone carrying a confederate flag - there is something wrong with that picture. That should never happen again,\" he said. \n\"It just reeks of everything we need to correct.\"  \nOfficer Goodman has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the Congressional medal of honour for his service. \n\"As Trump's fascist mob ransacked the US Capitol, this brave USCP officer kept murderous rioters away from the Senate chamber and saved the lives of those inside,\" wrote congressman Bill Pascal on Twitter. \n\"Last Wednesday, I was inside the Senate chamber when Officer Eugene Goodman led an angry mob away from it at great personal risk. His quick thinking and decisive action that day likely saved lives, and we owe him a debt of gratitude,\" wrote Senator Bob Casey on Monday. \nMr Goodman's standoff with the mob came just minutes before authorities were able to seal the chamber, according to reporting from the Washington Post.\nMembers of the 2,000-person Capitol police department are tasked with protecting the Capitol building and those inside of it. They are separate from DC police, who patrol the rest of the city. \nThe chief of the Capitol Police Steven Sund resigned last week following criticism over his force's response to the riots, including a public call from top Democrat Nancy Pelosi for Mr Sund to step down. \nActing US Attorney Michael Sherwin has said that the Justice Department will consider pursuing criminal charges against any Capitol police officers found to be complicit with the rioters. \nOfficer Howard Liebengood, 51, who was on duty during the riots died by suicide on Saturday, his family has said. A lawyer for Mr Liebengood's family called the 15-year department veteran a \"devastating loss\". \nOn Twitter, Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he and his team were \"heartbroken\" over Mr Liebengood's death. \"Howie was a familiar and cheerful presence, and also a friend to me and my staff,\" Mr Romney wrote. \"His bravery, kindness, and genuine care for others was deeply felt by all of us who had the privilege of knowing him.\" \nAccording to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, the Capitol police force has responded to a number of incidents of officers threatening to harm themselves after last week's attacks. \nMr Burkhalter said that responsibility for any security breakdowns rests with the department's leadership. \nWhen you get to the place where individual police officers, like Officer Goodman, have to make decisions on the deployment of resources, the battle has been lost, he said. \"It should never have gotten to that point,\" he said.

There were 112 positive cases at the 66 EFL clubs in its most recent round of testing. \nThe Football Association will be reminding everyone of their responsibilities.\nIt is understood there are no plans to halt elite sport but government ministers are concerned that the images from dressing rooms could make it harder to defend its continuation. \nA Whitehall source confirmed to the BBC that the celebrations at Chorley and Crawley Town had been noted by ministers, who last week warned football's authorities they had to do all they could to justify elite sport carrying on.\nIn his letter written to clubs on Monday, seen by BBC Sport, EFL chief executive Birch also said: \"Throughout the pandemic, football has provided a glimmer of hope for many millions of people affected by restrictions but we all understand the scrutiny the game remains under.\n\"While football is permitted to continue the actions of all participants will clearly be under the microscope. \n\"I am therefore personally asking you to re-double your efforts, to check, amend and tighten your protocol accordingly, and ensure that players and staff are left in no doubt as to their responsibilities on matchdays.\"\nProfessor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told BBC Breakfast that allowing team sports to continue was \"a balancing act\".\n\"The balancing act is trying to minimise the amount of contact outside very structured environments while trying to keep some semblance of life as will all know it,\" he said.  \n\"It is very much a matter for individuals in their day-to-day life. We have all got to say what, in our own lives, can we do to minimise the amount of impact we have on the NHS and the vulnerable?\"\nElite sport is not quite in the last-chance saloon, but the exemption it has been granted, at a time when grassroots sport has had to stop, cannot be taken for granted. \nA suspension is not yet imminent, but there are also no guarantees, especially if infection rates continue to rise, hospitals become overwhelmed, and the national lockdown has to be strengthened further. The government's patience seems to be wearing thin after the scenes of crowded dressing-room celebrations made a mockery of the social-distancing protocols that clubs were reminded of. \nThe optics of on-field hugs and handshakes, and fans gathering outside grounds, beamed into millions of homes at a time when the government is desperate for the public to stay at home and avoid contact with other households, is highly unhelpful to those making the case for professional sport to be allowed to continue. \nMy understanding is that ministers and medical experts' concerns do not amount to a final warning; they realise that the coverage of elite sport encourages people to stay at home and helps to retain some normality and balance in people's lives, and that protocols have largely been successful in suppressing transmission around training and fixtures. \nBut having warned sports bodies of their responsibilities last week, the government does now expect to see the football authorities in particular redouble their efforts, and for players' behaviour to reflect the privilege they enjoy in being able to continue to work when there has been so much disruption in so many people's work and lives. \nCertainly, football can ill afford any more high-profile breaches of the guidelines by players when away from their clubs.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the rules around celebrations in particular could be \"difficult to understand\".\n\"To control emotions when you are playing at 200mph is very difficult,\" he said on Monday.\n\"We are asking our players at corners, for example, to be man-marking people, pushing people around and not fist-bump anyone.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola voiced similar concerns, saying: \"When one guy scores a goal, I don't know if they can be controlled and not celebrate it.\n\"The joy to celebrate it, I don't know if [a player] is going to think: 'I cannot hug my mate for two, three seconds'.\"\nWolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo described the increase of cases as \"scary\".\n\"What I'm afraid of is the decision to stop - football as we know now will not be the same,\" he said.\n\"This is my biggest fear because the schedule will go crazy.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said: \"Everyone knows the situation and if it gets suspended I don't think it'd be a surprise.\n\"We'll just go with what the Government and Premier League have to say and, if it's the case to carry on, we'll carry on. But I don't think I'm being controversial if I say I don't think anyone would be surprised if we don't carry on with the way it's sweeping through the country.\"\nDespite fans not being allowed to attend matches, football still allows for some sense of escapism - a point Arteta emphasised.\n\"We know what we can bring to society if we are able to do it in safe way,\" he said.\n\"There are a lot of positives to take but it is just that balance. When we are still safe, we can add something positive without this difficult context.\""},

They also allege that Steinmetz forged documents linked to the deal.\nThe BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says Ms Toure has been described as the star witness for the prosecution, but her presence in court is unlikely - she now lives in the United States. She has not yet commented on this trial.\nMr Bonnant told Reuters news agency last month that Steinmetz had \"never paid a cent to Mme Mamadie Toure\" and said she was not married to Lansana Conte. \"She is not a public agent and therefore cannot be corrupted,\" he said.\nDespite its vast natural resources, Guinea remains one of the poorest countries in Africa, and has gained little from the Simandou iron ore riches. \nSteinmetz secured the rights in exchange for an investment of around $160m, but he then sold half of them on to Brazilian multinational mining company, Vale, 18 months later for $2.5bn, netting a massive profit.\nAt the time it was referred to as a \"jackpot\" deal in the financial press.

In a rare interview in 2012 he told the Financial Times that \"people don't like success\" and it was normal to pursue \"opportunities in an aggressive way\".\nGuinea's government stripped BSGR of its mining rights in 2014, citing evidence of corruption, which the company denied."},

But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents.\nDuring the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of him stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\" \nFor this revolutionary the harvest is still not over.\nMy introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out. \nThe piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings.\nIt is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity.\nHe is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure.\nMany young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language).\nBut the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around. \nIn his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the last election, he has been traversing the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets.\nAnd with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni has been keen to show his vitality. Last April, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November. \n\"If your father loves you, he has to empower you. In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern.\nThe economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power.\nOne of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty. \n\"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says.\n\"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent\u2026 he is an Africanist.\"\nNevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005.\nIndeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm.\nJournalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life.\n\"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote.\nBut something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits. \nHe had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age. \nAnd then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building. \nMany saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life.\nIt is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president. \nThe significance of patronage extends right through society.\nIt sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution.\nBut his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years.\n\"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council.\nWhile acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\".\nDespite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority.\nThe judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government. \nWhen judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.\nFor example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. \n\"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple.\nWhen it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment.\nThe media has also had its independence threatened.\nOn the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni. \n\"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala.\nBut outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds.\nBut perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered.\nAs it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents.\nKizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, once Mr Museveni's physician, first ran against him in the 2001 election. He has been detained and prosecuted on numerous charges, including rape and treason, but has never been convicted.\nNow that Bobi Wine, a singer whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is mounting a serious challenge to the president's rule, he has become the latest politician to face the wrath of the men in uniform.\nThe MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped. \nOn the campaign trail for this election, the police have arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups.\nDuring two days of protests in November following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces.\nSticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face.\nThrough his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control.

{"title": "How Mexico is reclaiming spirulina", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20210111-how-mexico-is-reclaiming-spirulina", "tag": "travel", "tag2": "story", "author": "Nicholas DeRenzo", "article_text": "\nIf you've spent any time dining in Mexico City recently, you may have noticed spirulina cropping up on menus in everything from the usual smoothies to more traditional dishes such as tortillas and \ntlayudas\n (a crisp tortilla base with refried beans and other toppings). But don't assume this is some symbol of encroaching hipster health food globalisation: in fact, centuries before it was deemed a \"superfood\", the vibrantly coloured cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae) \u2013 which grows primarily in warm alkaline lakes, ponds and rivers in the tropics and subtropics \u2013 was a pre-Hispanic dietary staple.\nThe Mexica \u2013 or Aztecs, as they were later known \u2013 harvested the protein-rich substance from the surface of Lake Texcoco, an expansive body of water in central Mexico that was later largely drained by the Spanish to make way for the construction of Mexico City. Here, the waters exhibited the perfect balance of salinity and alkalinity for spirulina to flourish. The Mexica called the foodstuff \ntecuitlatl\n, a Nahuatl word that roughly translates to \"rock excrement\", though they held it in decidedly higher esteem than its name suggests.\n\"Oral traditions say that the Mexica couriers and runners in ancient Tenochtitlan would eat dried spirulina cakes with corn, tortillas, beans, chillies or mole as fuel for long-distance travel,\" said Denise Vallejo, an indigenous first-generation Xicana chef who runs the vegan Los Angeles pop-up \nAlchemy Organica\n.\nEven without modern science, the Mexica could recognise the nutrient density that has made spirulina such a favourite today. It boasts about 60-70% protein by weight and has essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals, especially iron, manganese and B vitamins, according to the Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements. It's so healthy and relatively easy to grow, in fact, that \nexperts think it could be a potential food source for future Mars colonies\n.\nOf course, to the arriving Spanish conquistadors in the 16th Century, it mostly just looked odd. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo wrote in his 1568 memoir about \"a species of bread made of a kind of mud or slime collected from the surface of the lake, and eaten in that form, and has a similar taste to our cheese.\" And Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan included illustrations of spirulina harvesting in his 16th-Century ethnographic study, the Florentine Codex.\n\"After the Spanish invasion, most of its consumption declined with the draining of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico,\" Vallejo said. \"And many of the Spanish didn't enjoy its 'cheesy' or 'slimy' properties. Knowledge of its consumption was lost for a long time.\"\nThe Western world rediscovered the nutritious ingredient in the 1940s, when a French phycologist (a scientist who studies algae) noticed the Kanembu people along Africa's Lake Chad harvesting spirulina and turning it into sun-dried cakes called \ndih\u00e9\n. But it didn't make its grand return to Mexico until a happy accident in the 1960s, when the owners of Sosa Texcoco \u2013 which produced sodium carbonate and calcium chloride in a large snail-shaped pond on the remnants of Lake Texcoco \u2013 noticed a green substance mucking up the works. They reached out to French researchers, who concluded that it was the same organism that had been nourishing the Kanembu for generations. Rather than try to eradicate the cyanobacteria, Sosa Texcoco recognized its value, encouraged its growth and opened the world's first commercial spirulina company, Spirulina Mexicana.\nWhile Spirulina Mexicana has since closed, a micro-farm on the outskirts of San Miguel de Allende called \nSpirulina Viva\n is continuing the ancient tradition. Since 2010, American expat Katie Kohlstedt and her San Luis Potos\u00ed-born husband, Francisco Portillo, have grown fresh spirulina that probably tastes remarkably similar to what the Mexica harvested centuries ago. \"We're really proud to grow it here,\" she said. \"We didn't have to invent something new or bring something from somewhere else.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\n\u2022 \nMexico's ancient caviar\n\u2022 \nWhere there's no queso in quesadilla\n\u2022 \nMexico City's walking fish\nWhile many people may be familiar with spirulina in its dehydrated powdered form, Spirulina Viva sells the green stuff raw and frozen, which imparts a much more delicate flavour. \"Fresh spirulina should be creamy like a spreadable cheese,\" Kohlstedt said. \"If you closed your eyes, you might think you were eating a cross between an avocado and spinach.\" She noted that if you think of spirulina as fishy or an acquired taste, chances are you've been buying a lesser-quality product \u2013 or even one that uses ground fish bones to provide the phosphorus the spirulina needs to grow.\nKohlstedt and Portillo lead spirulina-growing workshops and have welcomed future farmers from as far away as Australia and Argentina. \"It's gardening combined with chemistry,\" Kohlstedt said of the process. But for many consumers, the finished product still remains a bit of a mystery. \"If I read one more article that said spirulina is grown in the ocean or [that shows] a picture of seaweed, I'm just going to scream,\" she said, with a laugh. \"My other two least favourite words are 'pond scum'. I think that's really offensive actually!\"\nKohlstedt recommends eating spirulina as simply as possible, stirred into warm miso soup or bone broth, blended into a smoothie, spread on bread or mixed into guacamole with extra lime juice, because vitamin C has been shown to help iron absorption. \"You're going to feel like you just ate Popeye's lunch,\" she said.\nIn Mexico City, chefs are getting even more creative with the ingredient. You might find spirulina dusting a tlayuda topped with avocado and \nescamoles \n(ant larvae) at \nBalc\u00f3n del Z\u00f3calo\n; brightening a superfood tortilla at \nCintli Tortilleria\n; adding a verdant punch to the smoothie bowls and cheesecakes at \nVegamo\n; and even spiking cocktails at the pre-Hispanic-inspired \nXam\na\nn Bar\n.\nThere, head bartender Kenneth Rodrigez has incorporated spirulina into a number of drinks, including a gin-based cocktail with Mexican lime and asparagus liqueur. \"I use it when somebody doesn't like egg whites or [in drinks for] vegan people, because spirulina has protein and we can get interesting textures,\" Rodrigez said, \"not to mention the incredible colour and the nutritional components that it provides.\"\u00a0\nHe describes the taste notes as \"green, herbal and \nclorofila \n(chlorophyll),\" and said that \"it can be used to enhance other flavours, because it has lots of minerals, like an alternative for salt.\"\u00a0\nAcross the border in Mexican American communities, using spirulina has meant establishing a direct connection with a pre-Hispanic past. At San Antonio's inventive Mexican restaurant \nMixtli\n, for instance, chefs Rico Torres and Diego Galicia featured spirulina on a special menu inspired by the Spanish conquest, and they participated in a collaborative D\u00eda de los Muertos dinner at New York's \nJames\nBeard House\n, where one of the hors d'oeuvres was a smoked spirulina yogurt with trout roe and radishes.\nAt Alchemy Organica, Vallejo incorporates spirulina powder into a pineapple \nagua fresca\n (a Mexican drink made with water, sugar and pureed fruits, seeds, flowers or grains for flavour) with lime and chia seeds. And she has even used it as \"a natural food colouring and nutritional boost, along with cactus and spinach powders\" to make vibrant green \nmasa\n (dough made with corn that has been nixtamalized, or treated with an alkaline solution), which she turns into colourful tortillas and tamales. \"I also use it as a flavour enhancer for some of my seafood-inspired dishes, as it imparts a flavour much like seaweed,\" she explained.\u00a0\nAnd when one of her cooks began selling fresh spirulina at a farmer's market, Vallejo took to simply scooping spoonfuls into her drinks. \"It gives you energy like you'd expect from a cup of coffee!\" she said.\nIn a sense, these chefs are tapping into something much deeper than simply taste or nutrition. Vallejo, who studies \ncuranderismo \n(folk medicine), said that spirulina is often viewed as a detoxifier to prepare for rituals, spells and \"visionary plant ceremonies\". And Kohlstedt has similarly heard about the ingredient's mystical connections, which draw on the similarities between spirulina's helical shape and our own building blocks as humans: \"Someone told me that the reason it's called 'spirulina' has to do with its spiral form, but that it also has to do with our DNA and how there is something really basic and spiritual about how we relate to plants [and cyanobacteria].\"\n\"So many of the 'superfoods' enjoyed today have a rich history in Mesoamerica: chia, amaranth, cacao, avocado, cactus,\" Vallejo noted. \"I think the current decolonising movement in Xicanx, Central American and other Spanish-speaking communities is helping us to rediscover and remember our ancestral foodways. We get to take back our foods and our plant wisdom.

It premiered on HBO in 1998 and ran for six seasons until 2004.\nThe show inspired two films, Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010.

Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it.\nBluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features.\nRaising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well.\nWi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in. \nConnecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers.\nUsing a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale.\nWorldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, \n.\nSmartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia.\nTaiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step.\nBut some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough.\nAs principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks.\nHe says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems. \n\"I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely.\"\nThere is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability. \n\"Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,\" he says.\nAnother challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi. \n\"Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,\" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks.\n\"The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,\" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly. \nOne solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection.\nIt can also be tricky to install smart locks.\nYale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws. \nHelpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky.\n\"I'm a bit of a door nerd now,\" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks.\nFor fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy. \nOne workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether. \nA server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. \"The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,\" she says. \nLock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens. \nSome want an \"active command and control experience\" using Siri or Alexa. \nBut others long for locks to \"do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,\" he says.\nIf we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in.\nThey can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.\nIf you, or someone you know, are affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) "},

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Atlanta and Feud: Bette and Joan. \nThe Sex Pistols electrified British music and, depending on who you believed, threatened the very fabric of society at the tail end of the 1970s. \nThey may only have survived for two years, but their angry, nihilistic singles and violent performances changed the idea of what rock and roll could be. \nOriginally formed in 1972 by Jones and drummer Paul Cook, they were galvanized by the addition of John Lydon - aka Johnny Rotten - whose abrasive vocals and anti-establishment lyrics defined the band and, to a large extent, the British punk movement.\nThey only released one album, but the sheer sonic force of songs like Anarchy In The UK, God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant became symbols of Britain's social and political turmoil, as youth unemployment soared, with young people particularly affected.\nNot that everyone was impressed by the Sex Pistols' curious combination of anger and apathy. \nTheir singles were blacklisted on the British charts and a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying their album cover. Facing bans across the UK, the group had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. - \"Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly\".\nAlways on the verge of chaos, they finally split up on a US tour in 1978. \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" a tired and disillusioned Johnny Rotten asked the audience at their final show - but their legacy was ensured.\n\"Imagine breaking into the world of The Crown and Downton Abbey with your mates and screaming your songs and your fury at all they represent,\" said Boyle, announcing his new project. \n\"This is the moment that British society and culture changed forever.

The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals.\nPCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment.\nA series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity.\nThe chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea.\nPCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises.\nOne killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded.\nAlthough levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely.\nPCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life. \nA recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a \"cocktail of pollutants\", which are passed down from mother to calf.\nScientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain.\nIn humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality.\nStrandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast.\nThe deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections.\nIn the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades.\nThe study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility.\n\"Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,\" said Rosie Williams.\nPopulations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility.\n\"This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,\" she said.\n\"That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals.\"\nThere are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber.\nThe study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.\nFollow Helen on \n."},

I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual.\nBut then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read. \nWith a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now.\nParler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too.\nTechnology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons.\n\"Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,\" she said.\nIt's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too.\nAgain, this is not unheard of. \nGab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days.\nWhat is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president.\nSince Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch.\nYouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance.\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as \"problematic\".\nEU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as \"the 9/11 moment of social media\", \n that \"the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing\".\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now \"taking editorial decisions\", adding that platforms were \"choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice\".\nElsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship.\nHe tweeted: \"The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship.\"\nThe fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter.\nOne of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse.\nPlatforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies.\nBut since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders.\nIn March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation.\nIt wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence.\nThe president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\".\nSocial media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets \"a pivotal precedent\" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post.\nSome analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide.\nOn Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election.\nPrivacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants. \n\"Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world. I think the president's removal might be the beginning of a purge for similar behaviour globally.\"\nIn his final hours on Twitter, Mr Trump once again blamed a piece of US legislation called Section 230 for \"banning\" free speech. During his presidency he threatened to repeal the law which makes social networks largely exempt from liability for their users' post.\nMany argue that removing the protection would actually harm free speech as networks would be forced to moderate far more than they currently do.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden has also stated that he would like to repeal the law to increase moderation and reduce the spread of fake news.\nIn the same final tweet Mr Trump said that he has been negotiating with \"various other sites\" and that there would be \"a big announcement soon\".\nIf the events of recent days are anything to go by, Mr Trump and some of his supporters face an uphill struggle against not just lawmakers but tech giants too before they can establish themselves on mainstream social media."},
{"title": "Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55575756", "tag": "news", "tag2": "world-europe", "author": "N/A", "article_text": "\nMember states decide individually who to vaccinate, when and where, but the EU is coordinating strategy and buying vaccines in bulk. On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021.\nBBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch.\nThe fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation.\nA recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground.\nVaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than\nfirst doses had been administered. \nBut some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses.\nMuch of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order.\nGermany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. \nMr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand.\nGermany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer.\nThe Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager.\nBut the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. \"We believed when we contributed \u20ac12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,\" he told a newspaper this week.\nThe country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to \n people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. \nIt has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature.\nHowever, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer.\nFrance's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to \n - still so small as to be statistically meaningless.  \nSo why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used.\nThe primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. \nEach recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives.\nAnother problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers.\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings.\nPolitically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a \"state scandal\", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free.\nRussia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity.\nSputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded.\nA poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week that \n had been vaccinated.\nBut one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown.\nRussia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped.\nAlmost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is still \nof how many others have received the vaccination. \nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains \"feasible\". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. \nAlongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February.\nSwedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine.\nA successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. \nMeanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands.\nIt seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further \nelderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial.\nThe mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be \"seamless and fast\", tweeting: \"If that does not work, shoot me.\"\nThe first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September.\nYou may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed.\nAfter getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its \"careful\" approach.\nAnd there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. \nIn a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least.\nSpain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with \npeople vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. \nEach of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. \nGovernment data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. \nAlthough vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination.\nHowever, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. \nThe arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by \"political affiliations or parliamentary needs\", a claim the central government has rejected.

But it says the design has \"great potential\".\nOne day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet.\nIn traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky.\nUnder a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload.\nMaveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\"There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,\" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant.\n\"We believe that we have to go into a really\u2026 breakthrough technology,\" she says.\nAn equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.\nResearchers there are working on a design known as the \"Flying-V\". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350.\nLike Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves.\nThe designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be \"plugged\" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once.\n\"We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,\" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology.\nThe design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany.\nThe flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success.\nResearchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as \"Dutch roll\". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as \"a somewhat rough landing\" that damaged the front landing gear.\nData from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator.\nAirlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V.\nThe attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact.\nBut with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as \"showstoppers\".\nAmong them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency.\nThere's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the \"wing\" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal.\nBuilding a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region.\n\"That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,\" says Mr Wright.\nAirbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer.\nIts rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing.\nAircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier.\nBoeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design.\nBut current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at \n - are based on proving that concept.\nFor longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power.\nOne major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane.\nBut the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities.\nThose priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion.\nAirbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power.\nIn September, Airbus \n.\nHydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing.\nBut there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide.\nIn order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution.\n\"Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,\" he explains."},

For nearly five years, she willingly paid the city's premium rents and taxes, while commuting to work in another state.\nBut the pandemic wore her down.\n\"I was like, 'The city's going to come back. By July, it's going to be ok.' But it just kept not being ok,\" she says.\n\"I wasn't planning on leaving at all,\" she adds. \"It was a complete switch.\"\nSince March, property firms and moving companies have reported a rush of demand from people leaving New York, many of them young families, as the pandemic drives demand for bigger homes and more outdoor space, while making relocation easier by expanding remote work.\nAnd so far, the surge hasn't shown signs of slowing, says Liz Nunan, president of property firm Houlihan Lawrence, which handles home sales in suburbs around New York City, and reported its best year on record in 2020.\n\"One of the things I learned in 2020 is that I have no idea what the future holds, but I feel rather bullish on 2021,\" she says. \"I believe we'll have a year that's nearly as strong as 2020 turned out to be.\"\nLast year, longer distance relocations from New York City helped push New York the state to the biggest population decline of any in the US, putting it on track for its first population fall of any decade since the 1970s. \nThe signs of outflow have spawned a small universe of articles debating whether New York City is dead or dying, and what - if anything - should be done to help it recover. \nAnd as the US confronts an economic crisis likely to outlast the pandemic that precipitated it, such concerns are not unique to the US's largest city.\nSmaller downtowns across the country have watched in despair as signs of long-sought revival - new restaurants, businesses in formerly abandoned buildings - disappear almost overnight.\n\"This is a difficult time for everybody,\" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank. \"The real issue is: can these cities hold their economic vitality?\" \nIn New York, the pandemic has closed theatres, emptied offices, halted tourism, and turned shopping and dining into hazards to be undertaken at your own risk, gutting industries that employed a fifth of the city's workforce.\nAs many as a third of the city's small businesses may not survive the pandemic, according to estimates by local business group, the Partnership for New York City. Most companies in the city's downtown do not expect staff to ever return to the office in full force. Some firms have already left.\nThe situation has \n - almost double the national average - swollen the ranks of the homeless, and helped spur the departure of more than 300,000 people like Andrea, further straining public finances.\nIn response, New York leaders have raised the prospect of increasing taxes and cutting services like transportation, garbage collection and park maintenance, while begging for emergency aid from Washington to resolve financial woes - pleas that so far have fallen on deaf ears.\nMichael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at the free market Manhattan Institute think tank, worries the potential cuts will further accelerate the outflow, hurting the very amenities that make city life attractive and leaving a poorer city for those who remain.\n\"It's not really so much the pandemic that is the greatest challenge to New York City,\" he says. \"It's really the second order consequences that have dealt a blow to the city's recovery and its citizens.\n\"New York is not dead, but it is on life support,\" he says. \"Whether its recovery is measured in months or years or decades is primarily determined by the degree of leadership that we see in the city. And I think that's why we should be so concerned.\"\nIn some ways, such worries are uniquely American, reflecting the safety woes and weak educational systems that set so many US cities apart from counterparts in Europe and Canada, says Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto. He predicts that coronavirus outflow from cities outside the US will be less dramatic and more temporary.\nIn the US, however, the urban revival of the early 2000s had shown signs of fading even before the pandemic, as immigration waned and moves to the suburbs accelerated. \nIn New York, the population has been falling since 2016.\nThe expansion of remote work caused by the pandemic means the city is now competing with even more places for businesses and families - trends that are unlikely to fully reverse even after life returns to normal, Prof Florida says.\n\"Talented people have choice now with remote work. Those choices will be made carefully,\" he says. \"The big winners are places with a lot of amenity, and the premium for amenity will grow. That means cities with wonderful coast lines or rural areas near mountains. Places like Miami Beach, or Bozeman, Montana, or Aspen, Colorado, or the Hudson Valley of New York.\" \nAndrea, who initially decamped to her mother's home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says she hasn't entirely written off New York. But for now, she's planning a cross-country road trip, working remotely while scoping out new cities to potentially call home.  \n\"I'm going to hop in the car\u2026 and drive around the country, and see if anything feels like a fit,\" she says. \"If it doesn't, then I'll see where the world is in September.\"\nKevin Pearsall and his wife left New York City in March for Atlanta, Georgia. After years of focusing on their careers in advertising, the 35-year-old says they wanted a hometown where they didn't feel like housing and other living costs remained a stretch - even on their healthy six-figure salaries.\nThey both landed jobs as remote workers for New York firms - another sign that convinced them the city was no longer the only place they could combine professional opportunity and social life.\n\"All of the great things about New York - speakeasies, beer gardens... that's not really as unique as it used to be,\" he says.\n\"We were already in motion, thinking about leaving,\" he says. The pandemic \"just accelerated\" the move.\nNew York leaders have expressed confidence that the city will remain a draw, noting that outflow of a few hundred thousand hardly makes a dent in a city of more than eight million. \n\"I'm not going to beg people to stay,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last year. \"I know this city will rebound. I know it. And I know others will come. They have for generations.\" \n\"We can't overrate this moment in history,\" he added. \"It is a passing moment. There will be a vaccine. And then all the strengths of New York City will reassert again.\"\nHow it will shake out in the long term remains a question.\nThe neighbourhoods that emptied during lockdowns last year were the city's wealthiest, but a Manhattan Institute survey this summer found that \n with dissatisfaction highest among those with lower incomes.\nMr Hendrix says it is tempting to hope a more affordable city will emerge if the rich depart, but he worries such an exodus will generate still more challenges, given how dependent the city is on high earners for tax revenue.\n\"It doesn't take a majority leaving the city or a majority changing their lifestyle to make a big difference,\" he says.\n is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nProf Florida says the biggest cities, like New York and San Francisco, are likely to remain a draw for young people, who should benefit if rents continue to fall. \nBut he warns that such declines were short-lived after previous crises. And elsewhere in America, he expects downtown business districts - \n - to face major challenges.\n\"The central business districts - those places which packed and stacked knowledge workers in the vertical towers - they are in for a real reckoning,\" he says.

Mr Wolf last week called on Mr Trump to \"strongly condemn\" the protesters who stormed Congress.\nThe outgoing secretary said his departure had been prompted by \"recent events\", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment.\nLaw enforcement around the country are said to be bracing for the possibility of further violence in the days before Joe Biden takes office. \nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.   \n around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. \nCalls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots.\nLocal police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses following last week's violence, according to US media. \nThe Reuters news agency, citing a federal law enforcement official, said the FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. \nAlthough the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were reported elsewhere in the country at the same time.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday that it would begin National Special Security Event (NSSE) operations for the inauguration six days early, starting Wednesday.\nThe designation allows a wide range of security and law enforcement agencies to coordinate together on special protective measures, like enforcing road closures and a secure perimeter.\nThe announcement came after Washington DC's Mayor, Ms Bowser, went public with her appeal to bolster security after what she described as an \"unprecedented terrorist attack\" at the US Capitol last week.\nShe has also asked Americans to avoid travel to Washington DC for the event. Inaugurations traditionally draw hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital, but the coronavirus pandemic had already curtailed those plans before security fears were heightened. \nThe Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, said Monday that 10,000 troops will be in Washington DC by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested by local officials.\nElsewhere, the National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid \"credible threats\" of further violence.  \n\"Groups involved in the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol continue to threaten to disrupt the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20,\" the service said in a statement, adding it could institute further temporary closures to other areas within the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \nSpeaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was \"not afraid\" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears.\nHis inauguration committee has announced that the ceremony will be themed around \"America United\". \nAfter being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. \nDonald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years not to do so.\nThe warnings about further pro-Trump violence come as efforts move forward to impeach the president for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol.\nAn article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" during a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was \"stolen\" from him. \nDemocrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office.\nMr Trump has made no public statements since \n - on Friday.\nIt comes as websites and social media networks crackdown against other users and websites seen to be encouraging violence - including social network Parler, \n.

He helped limit the spread of HIV, and more recently his harsh lockdown - which closed schools and business, banned vehicle movement and imposed mandatory public mask use in May - is credited with tackling the coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to Johns Hopkins University, \n and around just 300 deaths from the illness.\nBut while he was once hailed in the West as one of the new generation of African leaders, his critics accuse him of turning into another authoritarian leader. \nMr Museveni has no designated successor within his party, and in 2017 \n allowing him to run again for the presidency. \nHe has seen off a number of challengers to his rule over the years, notably long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was arrested numerous times and decided not to run again for the presidency in 2021. \nWhile Mr Museveni maintains a large support base, especially in rural areas, he is facing increasing opposition over rising inequality and his rigid control over the country.\nOne of 10 candidates challenging him for the presidency this year is musician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known by the stage name Bobi Wine. \nAffectionately referred to as the \"ghetto president\", the 38-year-old became an East African musical superstar in the early 2000s before switching to politics and winning a seat in parliament in 2017.\nBobi Wine is seen as the biggest challenge to Mr Museveni's rule and has mobilised many young people who have not previously been involved in politics. He has sharply criticised the president in the past and accused him of \"fearing the people\".\nThe president has not taken this challenge lightly. He has accused Bobi Wine of being a foreign agent of those \"who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda\" and said that opposition figures are misleading young people to get involved in violence on the campaign trail. \nBobi Wine has been arrested several times since he became involved in politics. He has spoken of a \"revolution\" against Mr Museveni. \n using the hashtag \"WeAreRemovingADictator\".\nPart of Bobi Wine's popularity comes down to his age. At 38, he is just half as old as President Museveni, in one of the youngest nations on earth. \n Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide, of just 15.7 - only Niger is younger. \nThe \"ghetto president\" grew up in a slum in the capital, Kampala. His background and his efforts to promote social justice in his country through his music and as a politician have endeared him to this younger, more urban generation. \nBut Bobi Wine has also surprised authorities by drawing big crowds of supporters in rural areas - thought to be a bastion of support for President Museveni.\nTensions are high, and the campaign has been marred by serious violence, which has left dozens killed and hundreds more arrested. \nOfficials have cited measures brought in to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic for their efforts to break up political gatherings. But \n that security forces are using these regulations \"as a pretext to violate rights and clamp down on the opposition and the media\". \n for allegedly breaching Covid measures. His detention sparked protest which led to a wave of arrests and left dozens dead, mostly allegedly shot by the security forces.\nAfterwards, \n and said \"police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence\".\n\"Can I repeat? Police have a right to shoot you and you die for nothing.... do it at your own risk.\"\nBobi Wine has since taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest and helmet on the campaign trail. \nAt the end of last year he halted his campaign after a number of his team were injured as security forces dispersed one of his political rallies. He later told broadcaster CNN he had survived several assassination attempts. \nA country of more than 42 million people, Uganda is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nIt has one of the highest refugee populations worldwide, hosting \n from neighbouring countries. \nSome are watching the political unrest in the country with concern, and worry about what could happen after the vote. There has never been a peaceful transfer of power in Uganda and it is not clear what would happen if Mr Museveni were to lose, and what the military would do.\nThe president announced a shake-up of the armed forces in November, bringing in the former head of Uganda's operations in Somalia, Maj Gen Paul Lokech, as deputy inspector general of police to coordinate security forces around the capital during the election period. \nThe European Union has chosen not to send observers to the election this year - reportedly because \n to make polling more fair - meaning there will be less international scrutiny.

The opposition says this is because it is popular in those areas, but the government says the measure is due to Covid-19 restrictions. \n\"We found this network to be linked to the government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda,\" Facebook said in a statement. \n\"They used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were,\" the statement continued. \nBut government spokesman Ofwono Opondo hit back in a \n, accusing Facebook of failing to adhere to \"natural justice\" and echoing suggestions by other government figures that the social network is trying to influence the election outcome. \n\"We are not familiar with anybody who complains about these accounts,\" he said. \"The owners have not received any notice and no-one was asked to make any response to the allegations.\"\nMr Opondo described Facebook as high-handed. \"I think they are playing the usual games,\" he added. \"We know that they have a side in this election perhaps.\" \nThe government spokesman said Thursday's elections would be free and fair.\nThe BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that the campaign period has been dominated by social media, as political parties moved to reach a young, politically aware population.\nMany new accounts promoting messages from both the ruling party and the opposition have popped up in the last couple of months, especially on Facebook and Twitter. In many cases, the users did not use proper names, and shared content filled with hate messages and fake news, she says. \nUgandans online have said saying that the government has finally got a taste of what it feels like to be censured.\nIn December, the Uganda Communications Commission, the media industry regulator, wrote to Google, asking it to shut down several YouTube channels associated with Bobi Wine.\nIn the past, the government body has ordered online content creators such as influencers and bloggers to register and have their material vetted before publication, but this was put on hold after it was challenged in court. \nDuring the 2016 election, the government blocked social media on polling day and for several after, which led to the proliferation of VPN use in the country.\nIt feels like there is a fresh wind blowing through social media in terms of how it deals with political content.\nFirst we saw US President Donald Trump banned from Twitter and Facebook and now that has been extended beyond the US to Africa. \nFacebook has shut a slew of accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials, accusing them of \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\" in the public debate ahead of Thursday's election.\nMark Zuckerberg has long insisted that the platform he founded has to allow all forms of free speech and cannot become an arbiter of political conversations.\nSo what has changed? The truth is that the platform has increasingly focused on misinformation in recent years but the violence and chaos witnessed at the heart of the US government in recent days have forced it to speed up these attempts, and make some pretty big decisions.\nThe days of describing itself as a mere conduit for content seem to be well and truly over.\nIt has tried lots of ways to reduce misinformation, including ranking reliable journalism higher than fake news and training algorithms to identify \"bad\" posts, but it has had mixed results.\nBut now with all eyes on it, it is going to have to find a way to deal with content in a way that pleases politicians, its users and its advertisers, who do not want to be associated with a platform that is being accused of inciting unrest or influencing the results of elections.\nIt remains unclear how it will do so in the long term but in the short term expect more knee-jerk reactions to political events around the world.\nAnd the new look for the social network will come at a price.\nSome Ugandan officials are already accusing it of meddling in its election. Facebook could be stuck between a rock and a hard place for some time to come."},

So I lowered the prices, as it was more important to protect people than to think of profit,\" the 35-year-old tells the BBC.\n\"I had to increase my production by 75% to meet the demand when the pandemic started, so Covid-19 has been good for my business.\n\"But I made sure I gave free soap to vulnerable people such as the elderly and the disabled.\"\nMr Havyarimana's initiative has been praised by the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, which often highlights the contribution of refugee entrepreneurs to their host communities.\n\"The refugees are playing a pivotal role in helping contain the spread of Covid-19 in Kakuma,\" Eujin Byun, a spokesperson for UNHCR in Kenya tells the BBC.\n\"They helped in many ways, from disseminating information about the virus to helping people take the necessary measures.\"\nShe added that she was not surprised by Mr Havyarimana's decision to lower prices.\n\"Refugees are very community-oriented and they will look after each other. They have previously stepped up and helped us do our jobs in situations like that.\"\nMr Havyarimana currently employs 42 people in his business, named Glap Industries - short for God Loves All People. The bulk of the workers are refugees but 18 are Kenyans from the town of Kakuma.\nGlap supplies local businesses and institutions outside the camp and even relief agencies.\n\"The agencies buy my soaps to give away to refugees who cannot afford them and for their own staff too,\" the Burundian proudly notes. \nMr Havyarimana is not the only local soap merchant, but he does not fear the competition, and in fact offers classes to teach people how to make cleaning products.\n\"I want to mentor women and younger people so they can have an opportunity to become self-reliant and improve their lives like I did,\" he says.\n\"I want to help the community in any way I can.\" \nEfforts like his may have helped keep Covid-19 at bay in Kakuma. \nThe most recent UNHCR figures, dating from 24 December, show that there had been 341 confirmed cases with 19 people under medical care. There have been 10 deaths from the virus.\nKenya has registered nearly 100,000 cases nationally, with around 1,700 deaths, health ministry figures show.\nPolitical instability and violence have forced more than 300,000 people to flee Burundi to neighbouring African countries in the last decade, according to the UNHCR.\nMr Havyarimana was in the middle of his chemistry studies at the University of Burundi when he left. He says his life was in danger and that he was receiving death threats from relatives of his late mother, who also seized his home.\nAfter arriving in Kakuma, he wanted to make money for himself, rather than relying on humanitarian aid.\nThe camp sits in an isolated and arid region where the provision of basic services is a challenge for relief agencies. \nExploring the region, Mr Havyarimana noticed there was not a soap factory, which meant that cleaning products had to be brought from elsewhere.\n\"I had no idea of how to make soap, so I started surfing the web for some knowledge,\" he explains.\nHe later enrolled in a soap-making course offered by the World Lutheran Federation aid agency, and with a loan from a former classmate in Burundi, he started the business alongside two helpers.\nHe also received grants from relief agencies including the UNHCR and NGOs such as the African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC), which says it has supported more then 18,000 refugee entrepreneurs.\n\"Innocent's story shows how refugees can contribute to their host communities in a number of ways,\" Julienne Oyler, the AEC's chair, tells the BBC.\n\"Camps like Kakuma are so isolated that entrepreneurs like him are a lifeline to basic goods and services at a time of lockdowns and other restrictions.\"\nA 2018 World Bank study identified over 2,000 businesses in Kakuma and estimated that they contributed more than $50m (\u00a337m) to the local economy every year.\nMichelle Richey, a lecturer in technology and entrepreneurship at the UK's Loughborough University specialising in refugee business ventures, says people like Mr Havyarimana are very import in changing the general perception of refugees.\n\"The human potential within refugees shows when we give them chances to work instead of just focusing on humanitarian issues,\" she says.\n\"We can help those people have some control of their lives again after all they have been through.\"\nStarting a thriving business is not the only change in Mr Havyarimana's life since arriving in Kakuma. In 2017, he married Aline, a fellow Burundian refugee he met at the camp. \nThey have two sons, and the youngest one, Prince, was born in late November. \nMr Havyarimana speaks with fondness about life in Kenya but he dreams of being resettled in Australia or Canada. \n\"I like Kakuma a lot, but I want to give my wife and kids a better life,\" he says.\nIn the meantime, Mr Havyarimana is focusing on expanding his ways to help the community, and as well as offering 21 kinds of soap and cleaning products, he has devised a hand sanitiser created from aloe vera grown in a patch just outside his workshop.\n\"Coronavirus has affected the whole world but for us here in Kakuma, it has made it even more important that we clean our hands in any we can,\" he says."},

Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony.\nThis is the second time Democrats have pursued impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nIn December 2019, the House impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020.\nNo US president has ever been impeached twice.\nHowever, the prospect of an impeachment conviction is unlikely because of Mr Trump's broad Republican support in the Senate.\nThe resolution drafted by three Democrats - who began writing it while under lockdown in the Capitol last Wednesday - consists of one article: \"Incitement of insurrection\".\n\"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,\" the resolution reads.\nIn the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in \"imminent lawless action at the Capitol\".\nThe resolution also says this was \"consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct\" the certification of President-elect Biden's election win.\n\"He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,\" the resolution says.\nImpeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial.\nArticles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial to decide whether to convict or not. There is no appeal against outcome.\nAn impeachment is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nMr Trump was the third US president to be impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were also left in office by the Senate.\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached in 1974, as political pressure built over the Watergate scandal.\nOn Monday, the Democrats presented a resolution to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president and the cabinet to declare Mr Trump unfit for office.\nThe resolution urged Mr Pence to \"declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the president is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office\".\nBut, as expected, the resolution was not adopted by unanimous consent in the House, after Republican Alex Mooney of West Virginia objected to the request.\nThe House has now gone into recess until Tuesday morning, when the chamber is expected to vote on the resolution.\nAfter the vote, the Democrats said they will give Mr Pence 24 hours to remove Mr Trump from office before they move toward impeachment.\n\"The president's threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,\" Speaker Pelosi said.\nAlthough Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment.\nImpeachments are usually long, drawn-out affairs, involving investigations and hearings that can take weeks to conclude. This impeachment is expected to be much quicker. \nMonday's presentation of the impeachment article to the House paves the way for a vote to be held. A simple majority in favour of impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Senate.\nHowever, an internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires.\nThe Senate is currently not in session, and all 100 senators would have to agree to change the schedule, which is highly unlikely.\nConstitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial when Mr Trump leaves office. But Democrats appear confident that the House can impeach Mr Trump and send the articles to the Senate for a trial at a later date.\nOn Sunday, Democratic House whip James Clyburn said the party may not send any articles to the Senate for trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office.\nIt's a new week in Washington DC, but the fallout from Wednesday's tragic events are just beginning.  \nWith only eight days left of Mr Trump's presidency, Democrats are very aware of the disruption an impeachment and a Senate trial would cause to the early days of Mr Biden's administration.\nThat's why there is talk of delaying Mr Trump's Senate trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office. \nAt that point, the pressure to remove Mr Trump will be past, but other punishments - stripping him of the accommodations and privileges ex-presidents enjoy and prohibiting him from future federal office - still apply.\nA year ago, Senate Republicans voted as a block to acquit the president of impeachment charges. This time, however, there may be some willing to side with Democrats to make sure that Trump, once out of power, never returns again."},

There were 112 positive cases at the 66 EFL clubs in its most recent round of testing. \nThe Football Association will be reminding everyone of their responsibilities.\nIt is understood there are no plans to halt elite sport but government ministers are concerned that the images from dressing rooms could make it harder to defend its continuation. \nA Whitehall source confirmed to the BBC that the celebrations at Chorley and Crawley Town had been noted by ministers, who last week warned football's authorities they had to do all they could to justify elite sport carrying on.\nIn his letter written to clubs on Monday, seen by BBC Sport, EFL chief executive Birch also said: \"Throughout the pandemic, football has provided a glimmer of hope for many millions of people affected by restrictions but we all understand the scrutiny the game remains under.\n\"While football is permitted to continue the actions of all participants will clearly be under the microscope. \n\"I am therefore personally asking you to re-double your efforts, to check, amend and tighten your protocol accordingly, and ensure that players and staff are left in no doubt as to their responsibilities on matchdays.\"\nProfessor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told BBC Breakfast that allowing team sports to continue was \"a balancing act\".\n\"The balancing act is trying to minimise the amount of contact outside very structured environments while trying to keep some semblance of life as will all know it,\" he said.  \n\"It is very much a matter for individuals in their day-to-day life. We have all got to say what, in our own lives, can we do to minimise the amount of impact we have on the NHS and the vulnerable?\"\nElite sport is not quite in the last-chance saloon, but the exemption it has been granted, at a time when grassroots sport has had to stop, cannot be taken for granted. \nA suspension is not yet imminent, but there are also no guarantees, especially if infection rates continue to rise, hospitals become overwhelmed, and the national lockdown has to be strengthened further. The government's patience seems to be wearing thin after the scenes of crowded dressing-room celebrations made a mockery of the social-distancing protocols that clubs were reminded of. \nThe optics of on-field hugs and handshakes, and fans gathering outside grounds, beamed into millions of homes at a time when the government is desperate for the public to stay at home and avoid contact with other households, is highly unhelpful to those making the case for professional sport to be allowed to continue. \nMy understanding is that ministers and medical experts' concerns do not amount to a final warning; they realise that the coverage of elite sport encourages people to stay at home and helps to retain some normality and balance in people's lives, and that protocols have largely been successful in suppressing transmission around training and fixtures. \nBut having warned sports bodies of their responsibilities last week, the government does now expect to see the football authorities in particular redouble their efforts, and for players' behaviour to reflect the privilege they enjoy in being able to continue to work when there has been so much disruption in so many people's work and lives. \nCertainly, football can ill afford any more high-profile breaches of the guidelines by players when away from their clubs.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the rules around celebrations in particular could be \"difficult to understand\".\n\"To control emotions when you are playing at 200mph is very difficult,\" he said on Monday.\n\"We are asking our players at corners, for example, to be man-marking people, pushing people around and not fist-bump anyone.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola voiced similar concerns, saying: \"When one guy scores a goal, I don't know if they can be controlled and not celebrate it.\n\"The joy to celebrate it, I don't know if [a player] is going to think: 'I cannot hug my mate for two, three seconds'.\"\nWolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo described the increase of cases as \"scary\".\n\"What I'm afraid of is the decision to stop - football as we know now will not be the same,\" he said.\n\"This is my biggest fear because the schedule will go crazy.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said: \"Everyone knows the situation and if it gets suspended I don't think it'd be a surprise.\n\"We'll just go with what the Government and Premier League have to say and, if it's the case to carry on, we'll carry on.

They also allege that Steinmetz forged documents linked to the deal.\nThe BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says Ms Toure has been described as the star witness for the prosecution, but her presence in court is unlikely - she now lives in the United States. She has not yet commented on this trial.\nMr Bonnant told Reuters news agency last month that Steinmetz had \"never paid a cent to Mme Mamadie Toure\" and said she was not married to Lansana Conte. \"She is not a public agent and therefore cannot be corrupted,\" he said.\nDespite its vast natural resources, Guinea remains one of the poorest countries in Africa, and has gained little from the Simandou iron ore riches. \nSteinmetz secured the rights in exchange for an investment of around $160m, but he then sold half of them on to Brazilian multinational mining company, Vale, 18 months later for $2.5bn, netting a massive profit.\nAt the time it was referred to as a \"jackpot\" deal in the financial press. But it also raised questions about why the initial rights were granted so cheaply. \nMo Ibrahim, the Sudanese telecom billionaire and anti-corruption campaigner, asked at the time: \"Are the Guineans who did that deal idiots, or criminals, or both?\"\nSteinmetz has always insisted he did nothing wrong. In a rare interview in 2012 he told the Financial Times that \"people don't like success\" and it was normal to pursue \"opportunities in an aggressive way\".\nGuinea's government stripped BSGR of its mining rights in 2014, citing evidence of corruption, which the company denied."},

But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents.\nDuring the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of him stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\" \nFor this revolutionary the harvest is still not over.\nMy introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out. \nThe piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings.\nIt is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity.\nHe is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure.\nMany young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language).\nBut the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around. \nIn his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the last election, he has been traversing the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets.\nAnd with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni has been keen to show his vitality. Last April, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November. \n\"If your father loves you, he has to empower you. In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern.\nThe economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power.\nOne of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty. \n\"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says.\n\"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent\u2026 he is an Africanist.\"\nNevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005.\nIndeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm.\nJournalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life.\n\"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote.\nBut something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits. \nHe had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age. \nAnd then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building. \nMany saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life.\nIt is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president. \nThe significance of patronage extends right through society.\nIt sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution.\nBut his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years.\n\"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council.\nWhile acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\".\nDespite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority.\nThe judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government. \nWhen judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.\nFor example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. \n\"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple.\nWhen it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment.\nThe media has also had its independence threatened.\nOn the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni. \n\"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala.\nBut outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds.\nBut perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered.\nAs it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents.\nKizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, once Mr Museveni's physician, first ran against him in the 2001 election. He has been detained and prosecuted on numerous charges, including rape and treason, but has never been convicted.\nNow that Bobi Wine, a singer whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is mounting a serious challenge to the president's rule, he has become the latest politician to face the wrath of the men in uniform.\nThe MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped. \nOn the campaign trail for this election, the police have arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups.\nDuring two days of protests in November following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces.\nSticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face.\nThrough his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control. He has also managed to reinvent himself. \nWhereas he was once the political upstart in his early 40s, anyone taking on that role now risks incurring his considerable wrath."},

{"title": "How Mexico is reclaiming spirulina", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20210111-how-mexico-is-reclaiming-spirulina", "tag": "travel", "tag2": "story", "author": "Nicholas DeRenzo", "article_text": "\nIf you've spent any time dining in Mexico City recently, you may have noticed spirulina cropping up on menus in everything from the usual smoothies to more traditional dishes such as tortillas and \ntlayudas\n (a crisp tortilla base with refried beans and other toppings). But don't assume this is some symbol of encroaching hipster health food globalisation: in fact, centuries before it was deemed a \"superfood\", the vibrantly coloured cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae) \u2013 which grows primarily in warm alkaline lakes, ponds and rivers in the tropics and subtropics \u2013 was a pre-Hispanic dietary staple.\nThe Mexica \u2013 or Aztecs, as they were later known \u2013 harvested the protein-rich substance from the surface of Lake Texcoco, an expansive body of water in central Mexico that was later largely drained by the Spanish to make way for the construction of Mexico City. Here, the waters exhibited the perfect balance of salinity and alkalinity for spirulina to flourish. The Mexica called the foodstuff \ntecuitlatl\n, a Nahuatl word that roughly translates to \"rock excrement\", though they held it in decidedly higher esteem than its name suggests.\n\"Oral traditions say that the Mexica couriers and runners in ancient Tenochtitlan would eat dried spirulina cakes with corn, tortillas, beans, chillies or mole as fuel for long-distance travel,\" said Denise Vallejo, an indigenous first-generation Xicana chef who runs the vegan Los Angeles pop-up \nAlchemy Organica\n.\nEven without modern science, the Mexica could recognise the nutrient density that has made spirulina such a favourite today. It boasts about 60-70% protein by weight and has essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals, especially iron, manganese and B vitamins, according to the Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements. It's so healthy and relatively easy to grow, in fact, that \nexperts think it could be a potential food source for future Mars colonies\n.\nOf course, to the arriving Spanish conquistadors in the 16th Century, it mostly just looked odd. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo wrote in his 1568 memoir about \"a species of bread made of a kind of mud or slime collected from the surface of the lake, and eaten in that form, and has a similar taste to our cheese.\" And Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan included illustrations of spirulina harvesting in his 16th-Century ethnographic study, the Florentine Codex.\n\"After the Spanish invasion, most of its consumption declined with the draining of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico,\" Vallejo said. \"And many of the Spanish didn't enjoy its 'cheesy' or 'slimy' properties. Knowledge of its consumption was lost for a long time.\"\nThe Western world rediscovered the nutritious ingredient in the 1940s, when a French phycologist (a scientist who studies algae) noticed the Kanembu people along Africa's Lake Chad harvesting spirulina and turning it into sun-dried cakes called \ndih\u00e9\n. But it didn't make its grand return to Mexico until a happy accident in the 1960s, when the owners of Sosa Texcoco \u2013 which produced sodium carbonate and calcium chloride in a large snail-shaped pond on the remnants of Lake Texcoco \u2013 noticed a green substance mucking up the works. They reached out to French researchers, who concluded that it was the same organism that had been nourishing the Kanembu for generations. Rather than try to eradicate the cyanobacteria, Sosa Texcoco recognized its value, encouraged its growth and opened the world's first commercial spirulina company, Spirulina Mexicana.\nWhile Spirulina Mexicana has since closed, a micro-farm on the outskirts of San Miguel de Allende called \nSpirulina Viva\n is continuing the ancient tradition. Since 2010, American expat Katie Kohlstedt and her San Luis Potos\u00ed-born husband, Francisco Portillo, have grown fresh spirulina that probably tastes remarkably similar to what the Mexica harvested centuries ago. \"We're really proud to grow it here,\" she said. \"We didn't have to invent something new or bring something from somewhere else.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\n\u2022 \nMexico's ancient caviar\n\u2022 \nWhere there's no queso in quesadilla\n\u2022 \nMexico City's walking fish\nWhile many people may be familiar with spirulina in its dehydrated powdered form, Spirulina Viva sells the green stuff raw and frozen, which imparts a much more delicate flavour. \"Fresh spirulina should be creamy like a spreadable cheese,\" Kohlstedt said. \"If you closed your eyes, you might think you were eating a cross between an avocado and spinach.\" She noted that if you think of spirulina as fishy or an acquired taste, chances are you've been buying a lesser-quality product \u2013 or even one that uses ground fish bones to provide the phosphorus the spirulina needs to grow.\nKohlstedt and Portillo lead spirulina-growing workshops and have welcomed future farmers from as far away as Australia and Argentina. \"It's gardening combined with chemistry,\" Kohlstedt said of the process. But for many consumers, the finished product still remains a bit of a mystery. \"If I read one more article that said spirulina is grown in the ocean or [that shows] a picture of seaweed, I'm just going to scream,\" she said, with a laugh. \"My other two least favourite words are 'pond scum'. I think that's really offensive actually!\"\nKohlstedt recommends eating spirulina as simply as possible, stirred into warm miso soup or bone broth, blended into a smoothie, spread on bread or mixed into guacamole with extra lime juice, because vitamin C has been shown to help iron absorption. \"You're going to feel like you just ate Popeye's lunch,\" she said.\nIn Mexico City, chefs are getting even more creative with the ingredient. You might find spirulina dusting a tlayuda topped with avocado and \nescamoles \n(ant larvae) at \nBalc\u00f3n del Z\u00f3calo\n; brightening a superfood tortilla at \nCintli Tortilleria\n; adding a verdant punch to the smoothie bowls and cheesecakes at \nVegamo\n; and even spiking cocktails at the pre-Hispanic-inspired \nXam\na\nn Bar\n.\nThere, head bartender Kenneth Rodrigez has incorporated spirulina into a number of drinks, including a gin-based cocktail with Mexican lime and asparagus liqueur. \"I use it when somebody doesn't like egg whites or [in drinks for] vegan people, because spirulina has protein and we can get interesting textures,\" Rodrigez said, \"not to mention the incredible colour and the nutritional components that it provides.\"\u00a0\nHe describes the taste notes as \"green, herbal and \nclorofila \n(chlorophyll),\" and said that \"it can be used to enhance other flavours, because it has lots of minerals, like an alternative for salt.\"\u00a0\nAcross the border in Mexican American communities, using spirulina has meant establishing a direct connection with a pre-Hispanic past. At San Antonio's inventive Mexican restaurant \nMixtli\n, for instance, chefs Rico Torres and Diego Galicia featured spirulina on a special menu inspired by the Spanish conquest, and they participated in a collaborative D\u00eda de los Muertos dinner at New York's \nJames\nBeard House\n, where one of the hors d'oeuvres was a smoked spirulina yogurt with trout roe and radishes.\nAt Alchemy Organica, Vallejo incorporates spirulina powder into a pineapple \nagua fresca\n (a Mexican drink made with water, sugar and pureed fruits, seeds, flowers or grains for flavour) with lime and chia seeds. And she has even used it as \"a natural food colouring and nutritional boost, along with cactus and spinach powders\" to make vibrant green \nmasa\n (dough made with corn that has been nixtamalized, or treated with an alkaline solution), which she turns into colourful tortillas and tamales. \"I also use it as a flavour enhancer for some of my seafood-inspired dishes, as it imparts a flavour much like seaweed,\" she explained.\u00a0\nAnd when one of her cooks began selling fresh spirulina at a farmer's market, Vallejo took to simply scooping spoonfuls into her drinks. \"It gives you energy like you'd expect from a cup of coffee!\" she said.\nIn a sense, these chefs are tapping into something much deeper than simply taste or nutrition. Vallejo, who studies \ncuranderismo \n(folk medicine), said that spirulina is often viewed as a detoxifier to prepare for rituals, spells and \"visionary plant ceremonies\". And Kohlstedt has similarly heard about the ingredient's mystical connections, which draw on the similarities between spirulina's helical shape and our own building blocks as humans: \"Someone told me that the reason it's called 'spirulina' has to do with its spiral form, but that it also has to do with our DNA and how there is something really basic and spiritual about how we relate to plants [and cyanobacteria].\"\n\"So many of the 'superfoods' enjoyed today have a rich history in Mesoamerica: chia, amaranth, cacao, avocado, cactus,\" Vallejo noted. \"I think the current decolonising movement in Xicanx, Central American and other Spanish-speaking communities is helping us to rediscover and remember our ancestral foodways. We get to take back our foods and our plant wisdom.

She got a lot of support \u2013 but she also still faces struggles.\u00a0\nA woman at a party insisted she could never pronounce Duncan\u2019s full first name, laughing instead at how different it was and asking where she was from. \u201cShe really, really acted like I had just come from another country\u2026 I really felt like I was so foreign to her,\u201d says Duncan, who has lived in Toronto for more than 40 years. At another get-together, a guest explained that her name was hard to pronounce and unilaterally reverted to \u2018Nana\u2019 instead.

Production will begin in late spring.\nThe trailer for the HBO Max show gives nothing away; It features numerous shots of New York, but none of the characters is seen on screen. \n\"I grew up with these characters, and I can't wait to see how their story has evolved in this new chapter, with the honesty, poignancy, humour and the beloved city that has always defined them,\" Sarah Aubrey, head of original content at HBO Max, said in a statement.\nThe original Sex and the City series, created by Darren Star, was based on Candace Bushnell's 1997 book of the same name. It premiered on HBO in 1998 and ran for six seasons until 2004.\nThe show inspired two films, Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010. A prequel series titled The Carrie Diaries, starring Anna Sophia Robb, aired on The CW in 2013/14. \nStar also created Netflix show \n, and many have drawn \n between that show and SATC.\nWhen it first burst on to our TV screens, Sex and the City was seen as revolutionary - four women talking openly about their love and sex lives, not to mention the sex scenes themselves.\nCosmopolitans and rabbit vibrators were trending before trending was a thing.\nWhile it was praised by many for its liberating female-led content, it also attracted criticism from some quarters who felt Carrie's ongoing pursuit of Mr Big (Christopher Noth) was not exactly an advert for female independence.\nIt was also accused of \n such as sexual harassment and for its \n, a criticism levelled at many older shows \nFashion was a hugely influential part of the series - the tutu worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in the opening credits, teamed with a fur coat and heels, was described as \nAnd Manolo Blahnik could never have dreamed of attracting so much publicity for his designer footwear.\nIt was a ratings smash, with the hotly anticipated finale in 2004 \nIn the UK, the final episode was \n.\nThe series was predictably most popular in the 18-34 age group.\nMany SATC fans will be disappointed that larger-than-life favourite Samantha Jones - played by Kim Cattrall - will not be returning for the sequel series.\nSamantha was Sex and the City's most outlandish character and arguably, the star of the show.\nWhile Miranda was juggling a career and motherhood, Charlotte was focused on marriage and motherhood and Carrie poured her neuroses into her New York Star column, Samantha was the character perhaps harder to relate to but someone we all wanted to be (at least a little).\nShe was fiercely independent and while caring for her friends, she always put her own needs before men.\nBut news Cattrall won't reprise the role in And Just Like That comes as no surprise after years of feud rumours which were later confirmed by the British-born Canadian actress.\nIn 2017, \n she had \"never been friends\" with her co-stars.\nShe said there was a \"toxic relationship\" and ruled out appearing in a third Sex and the City movie, denying that her decision was down to pay or \"diva\" demands.\nCattrall commented that former co-star Parker \"could have been nicer\" about the situation.\nA different actress could play Samantha in the future, she suggested.\n\"I played it past the finish line and then some and I loved it and another actress should play it,\" she said. \"Maybe they could make it an African-American Samantha Jones or a Hispanic Samantha Jones, or bring in another character.\"\nShe later \n after she sent condolences following the death of Cattrall's brother.\nIn an interview with \n shortly afterwards, SJP acknowledged Cattrall \"said things that were really hurtful about me\".\nParker said: \"So there was no fight; it was completely fabricated, because I actually never responded.\"\nOn Monday, \n to someone posting that SJP \"didn't tag Samantha Jones\" into her post announcing the new series.\n\"I don't dislike her. I've never said that. Never would. Samantha isn't part of this story. But she will always be part of us. No matter where we are or what we do. x.\" "},

Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it.\nBluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features.\nRaising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well.\nWi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in. \nConnecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers.\nUsing a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale.\nWorldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, \n.\nSmartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia.\nTaiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step.\nBut some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough.\nAs principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks.\nHe says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems. \n\"I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely.\"\nThere is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability. \n\"Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,\" he says.\nAnother challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi. \n\"Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,\" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks.\n\"The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,\" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly. \nOne solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection.\nIt can also be tricky to install smart locks.\nYale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws. \nHelpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky.\n\"I'm a bit of a door nerd now,\" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks.\nFor fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy. \nOne workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether. \nA server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. \"The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,\" she says. \nLock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens. \nSome want an \"active command and control experience\" using Siri or Alexa. \nBut others long for locks to \"do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,\" he says.\nIf we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in.\nThey can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.\nIf you, or someone you know, are affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) "},

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Atlanta and Feud: Bette and Joan. \nThe Sex Pistols electrified British music and, depending on who you believed, threatened the very fabric of society at the tail end of the 1970s. \nThey may only have survived for two years, but their angry, nihilistic singles and violent performances changed the idea of what rock and roll could be. \nOriginally formed in 1972 by Jones and drummer Paul Cook, they were galvanized by the addition of John Lydon - aka Johnny Rotten - whose abrasive vocals and anti-establishment lyrics defined the band and, to a large extent, the British punk movement.\nThey only released one album, but the sheer sonic force of songs like Anarchy In The UK, God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant became symbols of Britain's social and political turmoil, as youth unemployment soared, with young people particularly affected.\nNot that everyone was impressed by the Sex Pistols' curious combination of anger and apathy. \nTheir singles were blacklisted on the British charts and a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying their album cover. Facing bans across the UK, the group had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. - \"Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly\".\nAlways on the verge of chaos, they finally split up on a US tour in 1978. \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" a tired and disillusioned Johnny Rotten asked the audience at their final show - but their legacy was ensured.\n\"Imagine breaking into the world of The Crown and Downton Abbey with your mates and screaming your songs and your fury at all they represent,\" said Boyle, announcing his new project. \n\"This is the moment that British society and culture changed forever. It is the detonation point for British street culture... where ordinary young people had the stage and vented their fury and their fashion\u2026and everyone had to watch and listen\".\nThe series is based on Steve Jones's memoir, Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol; which doesn't just focus on his time with the band.\nIt begins in West London, where the young musician suffered maternal neglect and sexual abuse by a step-father, and quickly fell into crime - including an attempt to climb the chimneys of Battersea Power Station, and stealing amps from a David Bowie gig.\nAfter becoming entranced by the glam rock scene, he is taken under the wings of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who helped form, style and promote the Sex Pistols.\nThe book demystifies the band behind the myth - showing how they struggled with the criticisms lobbed their way and the pressure of living up to their image, including the moment Jones was goaded into swearing live on primetime TV.\nLater chapters deal with his battles with addiction, and his recent reinvention as a tee-total \"semi-retired sexual deviant who doesn't really act out so much any more\".\nBritish-born, Australian-raised actor Toby Wallace will play Jones, following eye-catching roles in the coming-of-age drama Babyteeth and Netflix drama The Society, where he played evil teen Campbell Elliot.\nAnson Boon, last seen in the Kate Winslet tear-jerker Blackbird takes on the spittle-flecked role of Johnny Rotten; while out-of-control bassist Sid Vicious will be played by Louis Partridge.\nSydney Chandler - daughter of film star Kyle - will become Pretenders star Chrissie Hynde, who had an affair with Jones at the height of the Sex Pistols' fame.\nThe Witcher's Emma Appleton is cast as Nancy Spungen, the American girlfriend of Sid Vicious, who died in mysterious circumstances in October 1978.\nAnd Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams plays \"the face of punk\", the iconoclastic model and actress Pamela Rooke, whose signature style - ripped fishnets, dominatrix heels and raccoon-like eye make-up - defined the scene.\nThe Sex Pistols project isn't the only musical series in the pipeline.

The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals.\nPCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment.\nA series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity.\nThe chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea.\nPCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises.\nOne killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded.\nAlthough levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely.\nPCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life. \nA recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a \"cocktail of pollutants\", which are passed down from mother to calf.\nScientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain.\nIn humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality.\nStrandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast.\nThe deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections.\nIn the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades.\nThe study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility.\n\"Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,\" said Rosie Williams.\nPopulations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility.\n\"This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,\" she said.\n\"That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals.\"\nThere are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber.\nThe study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.\nFollow Helen on \n."},

I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual.\nBut then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read. \nWith a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now.\nParler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too.\nTechnology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons.\n\"Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,\" she said.\nIt's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too.\nAgain, this is not unheard of. \nGab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days.\nWhat is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president.\nSince Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch.\nYouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance.\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as \"problematic\".\nEU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as \"the 9/11 moment of social media\", \n that \"the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing\".\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now \"taking editorial decisions\", adding that platforms were \"choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice\".\nElsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship.\nHe tweeted: \"The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship.\"\nThe fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter.\nOne of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse.\nPlatforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies.\nBut since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders.\nIn March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation.\nIt wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence.\nThe president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\".\nSocial media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets \"a pivotal precedent\" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post.\nSome analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide.\nOn Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election.\nPrivacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants. \n\"Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world. I think the president's removal might be the beginning of a purge for similar behaviour globally.\"\nIn his final hours on Twitter, Mr Trump once again blamed a piece of US legislation called Section 230 for \"banning\" free speech. During his presidency he threatened to repeal the law which makes social networks largely exempt from liability for their users' post.\nMany argue that removing the protection would actually harm free speech as networks would be forced to moderate far more than they currently do.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden has also stated that he would like to repeal the law to increase moderation and reduce the spread of fake news.\nIn the same final tweet Mr Trump said that he has been negotiating with \"various other sites\" and that there would be \"a big announcement soon\".\nIf the events of recent days are anything to go by, Mr Trump and some of his supporters face an uphill struggle against not just lawmakers but tech giants too before they can establish themselves on mainstream social media."},
{"title": "Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55575756", "tag": "news", "tag2": "world-europe", "author": "N/A", "article_text": "\nMember states decide individually who to vaccinate, when and where, but the EU is coordinating strategy and buying vaccines in bulk. On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021.\nBBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch.\nThe fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation.\nA recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground.\nVaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than\nfirst doses had been administered. \nBut some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses.\nMuch of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order.\nGermany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. \nMr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand.\nGermany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer.\nThe Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager.\nBut the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. \"We believed when we contributed \u20ac12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,\" he told a newspaper this week.\nThe country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to \n people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. \nIt has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature.\nHowever, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer.\nFrance's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to \n - still so small as to be statistically meaningless.  \nSo why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used.\nThe primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. \nEach recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives.\nAnother problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers.\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings.\nPolitically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a \"state scandal\", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free.\nRussia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity.\nSputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded.\nA poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week that \n had been vaccinated.\nBut one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown.\nRussia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped.\nAlmost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is still \nof how many others have received the vaccination. \nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains \"feasible\". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. \nAlongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February.\nSwedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine.\nA successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. \nMeanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands.\nIt seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further \nelderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial.\nThe mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be \"seamless and fast\", tweeting: \"If that does not work, shoot me.\"\nThe first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September.\nYou may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed.\nAfter getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its \"careful\" approach.\nAnd there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. \nIn a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least.\nSpain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with \npeople vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. \nEach of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. \nGovernment data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. \nAlthough vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination.\nHowever, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. \nThe arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by \"political affiliations or parliamentary needs\", a claim the central government has rejected.

But it says the design has \"great potential\".\nOne day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet.\nIn traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky.\nUnder a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload.\nMaveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\"There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,\" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant.\n\"We believe that we have to go into a really\u2026 breakthrough technology,\" she says.\nAn equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.\nResearchers there are working on a design known as the \"Flying-V\". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350.\nLike Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves.\nThe designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be \"plugged\" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once.\n\"We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,\" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology.\nThe design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany.\nThe flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success.\nResearchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as \"Dutch roll\". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as \"a somewhat rough landing\" that damaged the front landing gear.\nData from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator.\nAirlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V.\nThe attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact.\nBut with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as \"showstoppers\".\nAmong them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency.\nThere's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the \"wing\" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal.\nBuilding a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region.\n\"That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,\" says Mr Wright.\nAirbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer.\nIts rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing.\nAircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier.\nBoeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design.\nBut current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at \n - are based on proving that concept.\nFor longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power.\nOne major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane.\nBut the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities.\nThose priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion.\nAirbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power.\nIn September, Airbus \n.\nHydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing.\nBut there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide.\nIn order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution.\n\"Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,\" he explains."},

But it just kept not being ok,\" she says.\n\"I wasn't planning on leaving at all,\" she adds. \"It was a complete switch.\"\nSince March, property firms and moving companies have reported a rush of demand from people leaving New York, many of them young families, as the pandemic drives demand for bigger homes and more outdoor space, while making relocation easier by expanding remote work.\nAnd so far, the surge hasn't shown signs of slowing, says Liz Nunan, president of property firm Houlihan Lawrence, which handles home sales in suburbs around New York City, and reported its best year on record in 2020.\n\"One of the things I learned in 2020 is that I have no idea what the future holds, but I feel rather bullish on 2021,\" she says. \"I believe we'll have a year that's nearly as strong as 2020 turned out to be.\"\nLast year, longer distance relocations from New York City helped push New York the state to the biggest population decline of any in the US, putting it on track for its first population fall of any decade since the 1970s. \nThe signs of outflow have spawned a small universe of articles debating whether New York City is dead or dying, and what - if anything - should be done to help it recover. \nAnd as the US confronts an economic crisis likely to outlast the pandemic that precipitated it, such concerns are not unique to the US's largest city.\nSmaller downtowns across the country have watched in despair as signs of long-sought revival - new restaurants, businesses in formerly abandoned buildings - disappear almost overnight.\n\"This is a difficult time for everybody,\" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank. \"The real issue is: can these cities hold their economic vitality?\" \nIn New York, the pandemic has closed theatres, emptied offices, halted tourism, and turned shopping and dining into hazards to be undertaken at your own risk, gutting industries that employed a fifth of the city's workforce.\nAs many as a third of the city's small businesses may not survive the pandemic, according to estimates by local business group, the Partnership for New York City. Most companies in the city's downtown do not expect staff to ever return to the office in full force. Some firms have already left.\nThe situation has \n - almost double the national average - swollen the ranks of the homeless, and helped spur the departure of more than 300,000 people like Andrea, further straining public finances.\nIn response, New York leaders have raised the prospect of increasing taxes and cutting services like transportation, garbage collection and park maintenance, while begging for emergency aid from Washington to resolve financial woes - pleas that so far have fallen on deaf ears.\nMichael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at the free market Manhattan Institute think tank, worries the potential cuts will further accelerate the outflow, hurting the very amenities that make city life attractive and leaving a poorer city for those who remain.\n\"It's not really so much the pandemic that is the greatest challenge to New York City,\" he says. \"It's really the second order consequences that have dealt a blow to the city's recovery and its citizens.\n\"New York is not dead, but it is on life support,\" he says. \"Whether its recovery is measured in months or years or decades is primarily determined by the degree of leadership that we see in the city. And I think that's why we should be so concerned.\"\nIn some ways, such worries are uniquely American, reflecting the safety woes and weak educational systems that set so many US cities apart from counterparts in Europe and Canada, says Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto. He predicts that coronavirus outflow from cities outside the US will be less dramatic and more temporary.\nIn the US, however, the urban revival of the early 2000s had shown signs of fading even before the pandemic, as immigration waned and moves to the suburbs accelerated. \nIn New York, the population has been falling since 2016.\nThe expansion of remote work caused by the pandemic means the city is now competing with even more places for businesses and families - trends that are unlikely to fully reverse even after life returns to normal, Prof Florida says.\n\"Talented people have choice now with remote work. Those choices will be made carefully,\" he says. \"The big winners are places with a lot of amenity, and the premium for amenity will grow. That means cities with wonderful coast lines or rural areas near mountains. Places like Miami Beach, or Bozeman, Montana, or Aspen, Colorado, or the Hudson Valley of New York.\" \nAndrea, who initially decamped to her mother's home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says she hasn't entirely written off New York. But for now, she's planning a cross-country road trip, working remotely while scoping out new cities to potentially call home.  \n\"I'm going to hop in the car\u2026 and drive around the country, and see if anything feels like a fit,\" she says. \"If it doesn't, then I'll see where the world is in September.\"\nKevin Pearsall and his wife left New York City in March for Atlanta, Georgia. After years of focusing on their careers in advertising, the 35-year-old says they wanted a hometown where they didn't feel like housing and other living costs remained a stretch - even on their healthy six-figure salaries.\nThey both landed jobs as remote workers for New York firms - another sign that convinced them the city was no longer the only place they could combine professional opportunity and social life.\n\"All of the great things about New York - speakeasies, beer gardens... that's not really as unique as it used to be,\" he says.\n\"We were already in motion, thinking about leaving,\" he says. The pandemic \"just accelerated\" the move.\nNew York leaders have expressed confidence that the city will remain a draw, noting that outflow of a few hundred thousand hardly makes a dent in a city of more than eight million. \n\"I'm not going to beg people to stay,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last year. \"I know this city will rebound. I know it. And I know others will come. They have for generations.\" \n\"We can't overrate this moment in history,\" he added. \"It is a passing moment. There will be a vaccine. And then all the strengths of New York City will reassert again.\"\nHow it will shake out in the long term remains a question.\nThe neighbourhoods that emptied during lockdowns last year were the city's wealthiest, but a Manhattan Institute survey this summer found that \n with dissatisfaction highest among those with lower incomes.\nMr Hendrix says it is tempting to hope a more affordable city will emerge if the rich depart, but he worries such an exodus will generate still more challenges, given how dependent the city is on high earners for tax revenue.\n\"It doesn't take a majority leaving the city or a majority changing their lifestyle to make a big difference,\" he says.\n is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nProf Florida says the biggest cities, like New York and San Francisco, are likely to remain a draw for young people, who should benefit if rents continue to fall. \nBut he warns that such declines were short-lived after previous crises. And elsewhere in America, he expects downtown business districts - \n - to face major challenges.\n\"The central business districts - those places which packed and stacked knowledge workers in the vertical towers - they are in for a real reckoning,\" he says.

In this image, the oil paintings of political figures in the background emphasise this imagery of the past.\nThere have been renewed calls for the Confederate flag to be banned across the US following the anti-racism protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, a black man.\nHowever Mr Trump has defended use of the flag, calling it a matter of free speech.\nOne man in a Trump beanie here walks between the red guide ropes, as many visitors might do on a guided-tour to view the Crypt, the Statuary Hall and the Rotunda.\nBut this man is carrying a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, as he poses in front of a painting depicting the surrender of Gen Burgoyne in the war of independence. \nAnother man, identified as Jake Angeli, an ardent Trump supporter who has attended a number of the president's rallies, shouts as he makes his way to the Senate Chamber. \nHis incongruous garments set him apart from other protesters wearing black hoodies. These Trump activists stand by taking selfies, but he has clearly come here to be photographed by others.\nThe apparent lack of a security presence is in sharp contrast to other Washington protests where there is a highly visible presence of heavily armed security forces protecting US institutions.\nAnother Trump supporter, identified as Richard Barnett, sits with one boot disrespectfully on a desk that is at the very centre of power in Congress. It is in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \nIn the scene, unimaginable days earlier, Barnett in his baseball cap and checked shirt resembles a raconteur regaling friends with tales of his exploits. \nThe image went viral as did pictures of the notes he and others left on Ms Pelosi's desk.\nThis dramatic image shows how the formal proceedings came to a violent halt as Capitol police officers drew their guns on doors being attacked by protesters intent on entering the House Chamber.\nMany commentators asked if they were watching a coup unfold as doors were barricaded and firearms brandished.\nThe composition is reminiscent of a scene in a Hollywood Western, the lawmen bracing for the doors to be breached.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden made an impassioned TV address describing the scenes as \"an assault on democracy\" - this chilling picture encapsulates what he meant.

Mr Wolf last week called on Mr Trump to \"strongly condemn\" the protesters who stormed Congress.\nThe outgoing secretary said his departure had been prompted by \"recent events\", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment.\nLaw enforcement around the country are said to be bracing for the possibility of further violence in the days before Joe Biden takes office. \nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.   \n around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. \nCalls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots.\nLocal police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses following last week's violence, according to US media. \nThe Reuters news agency, citing a federal law enforcement official, said the FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. \nAlthough the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were reported elsewhere in the country at the same time.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday that it would begin National Special Security Event (NSSE) operations for the inauguration six days early, starting Wednesday.\nThe designation allows a wide range of security and law enforcement agencies to coordinate together on special protective measures, like enforcing road closures and a secure perimeter.\nThe announcement came after Washington DC's Mayor, Ms Bowser, went public with her appeal to bolster security after what she described as an \"unprecedented terrorist attack\" at the US Capitol last week.\nShe has also asked Americans to avoid travel to Washington DC for the event. Inaugurations traditionally draw hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital, but the coronavirus pandemic had already curtailed those plans before security fears were heightened. \nThe Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, said Monday that 10,000 troops will be in Washington DC by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested by local officials.\nElsewhere, the National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid \"credible threats\" of further violence.  \n\"Groups involved in the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol continue to threaten to disrupt the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20,\" the service said in a statement, adding it could institute further temporary closures to other areas within the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \nSpeaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was \"not afraid\" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears.\nHis inauguration committee has announced that the ceremony will be themed around \"America United\". \nAfter being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. \nDonald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years not to do so.\nThe warnings about further pro-Trump violence come as efforts move forward to impeach the president for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol.\nAn article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" during a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was \"stolen\" from him. \nDemocrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office.\nMr Trump has made no public statements since \n - on Friday.\nIt comes as websites and social media networks crackdown against other users and websites seen to be encouraging violence - including social network Parler, \n.

The 76-year-old faces 10 challengers, most notably the pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine. \nHuman rights groups have accused security forces of using excessive force to break up opposition rallies during the campaign. But the government says the strong measures are necessary to ensure people comply with a ban on large crowds imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nHere are the five things you need to know about the crucial vote:\nPresident Museveni is one of the longest-serving presidents in Africa. He and his National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986 at the end of a five-year war, and have led Uganda ever since.\nHis supporters praise him for bringing relative peace and prosperity to the country, and in particular for his policies on health. He helped limit the spread of HIV, and more recently his harsh lockdown - which closed schools and business, banned vehicle movement and imposed mandatory public mask use in May - is credited with tackling the coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to Johns Hopkins University, \n and around just 300 deaths from the illness.\nBut while he was once hailed in the West as one of the new generation of African leaders, his critics accuse him of turning into another authoritarian leader. \nMr Museveni has no designated successor within his party, and in 2017 \n allowing him to run again for the presidency. \nHe has seen off a number of challengers to his rule over the years, notably long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was arrested numerous times and decided not to run again for the presidency in 2021. \nWhile Mr Museveni maintains a large support base, especially in rural areas, he is facing increasing opposition over rising inequality and his rigid control over the country.\nOne of 10 candidates challenging him for the presidency this year is musician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known by the stage name Bobi Wine. \nAffectionately referred to as the \"ghetto president\", the 38-year-old became an East African musical superstar in the early 2000s before switching to politics and winning a seat in parliament in 2017.\nBobi Wine is seen as the biggest challenge to Mr Museveni's rule and has mobilised many young people who have not previously been involved in politics. He has sharply criticised the president in the past and accused him of \"fearing the people\".\nThe president has not taken this challenge lightly. He has accused Bobi Wine of being a foreign agent of those \"who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda\" and said that opposition figures are misleading young people to get involved in violence on the campaign trail. \nBobi Wine has been arrested several times since he became involved in politics. He has spoken of a \"revolution\" against Mr Museveni. \n using the hashtag \"WeAreRemovingADictator\".\nPart of Bobi Wine's popularity comes down to his age. At 38, he is just half as old as President Museveni, in one of the youngest nations on earth. \n Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide, of just 15.7 - only Niger is younger. \nThe \"ghetto president\" grew up in a slum in the capital, Kampala. His background and his efforts to promote social justice in his country through his music and as a politician have endeared him to this younger, more urban generation. \nBut Bobi Wine has also surprised authorities by drawing big crowds of supporters in rural areas - thought to be a bastion of support for President Museveni.\nTensions are high, and the campaign has been marred by serious violence, which has left dozens killed and hundreds more arrested. \nOfficials have cited measures brought in to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic for their efforts to break up political gatherings. But \n that security forces are using these regulations \"as a pretext to violate rights and clamp down on the opposition and the media\". \n for allegedly breaching Covid measures. His detention sparked protest which led to a wave of arrests and left dozens dead, mostly allegedly shot by the security forces.\nAfterwards, \n and said \"police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence\".\n\"Can I repeat? Police have a right to shoot you and you die for nothing.... do it at your own risk.\"\nBobi Wine has since taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest and helmet on the campaign trail. \nAt the end of last year he halted his campaign after a number of his team were injured as security forces dispersed one of his political rallies. He later told broadcaster CNN he had survived several assassination attempts. \nA country of more than 42 million people, Uganda is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nIt has one of the highest refugee populations worldwide, hosting \n from neighbouring countries. \nSome are watching the political unrest in the country with concern, and worry about what could happen after the vote. There has never been a peaceful transfer of power in Uganda and it is not clear what would happen if Mr Museveni were to lose, and what the military would do.\nThe president announced a shake-up of the armed forces in November, bringing in the former head of Uganda's operations in Somalia, Maj Gen Paul Lokech, as deputy inspector general of police to coordinate security forces around the capital during the election period. \nThe European Union has chosen not to send observers to the election this year - reportedly because \n to make polling more fair - meaning there will be less international scrutiny.

The opposition says this is because it is popular in those areas, but the government says the measure is due to Covid-19 restrictions. \n\"We found this network to be linked to the government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda,\" Facebook said in a statement. \n\"They used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were,\" the statement continued. \nBut government spokesman Ofwono Opondo hit back in a \n, accusing Facebook of failing to adhere to \"natural justice\" and echoing suggestions by other government figures that the social network is trying to influence the election outcome. \n\"We are not familiar with anybody who complains about these accounts,\" he said. \"The owners have not received any notice and no-one was asked to make any response to the allegations.\"\nMr Opondo described Facebook as high-handed. \"I think they are playing the usual games,\" he added. \"We know that they have a side in this election perhaps.\" \nThe government spokesman said Thursday's elections would be free and fair.\nThe BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that the campaign period has been dominated by social media, as political parties moved to reach a young, politically aware population.\nMany new accounts promoting messages from both the ruling party and the opposition have popped up in the last couple of months, especially on Facebook and Twitter. In many cases, the users did not use proper names, and shared content filled with hate messages and fake news, she says. \nUgandans online have said saying that the government has finally got a taste of what it feels like to be censured.\nIn December, the Uganda Communications Commission, the media industry regulator, wrote to Google, asking it to shut down several YouTube channels associated with Bobi Wine.\nIn the past, the government body has ordered online content creators such as influencers and bloggers to register and have their material vetted before publication, but this was put on hold after it was challenged in court. \nDuring the 2016 election, the government blocked social media on polling day and for several after, which led to the proliferation of VPN use in the country.\nIt feels like there is a fresh wind blowing through social media in terms of how it deals with political content.\nFirst we saw US President Donald Trump banned from Twitter and Facebook and now that has been extended beyond the US to Africa. \nFacebook has shut a slew of accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials, accusing them of \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\" in the public debate ahead of Thursday's election.\nMark Zuckerberg has long insisted that the platform he founded has to allow all forms of free speech and cannot become an arbiter of political conversations.\nSo what has changed? The truth is that the platform has increasingly focused on misinformation in recent years but the violence and chaos witnessed at the heart of the US government in recent days have forced it to speed up these attempts, and make some pretty big decisions.\nThe days of describing itself as a mere conduit for content seem to be well and truly over.\nIt has tried lots of ways to reduce misinformation, including ranking reliable journalism higher than fake news and training algorithms to identify \"bad\" posts, but it has had mixed results.\nBut now with all eyes on it, it is going to have to find a way to deal with content in a way that pleases politicians, its users and its advertisers, who do not want to be associated with a platform that is being accused of inciting unrest or influencing the results of elections.\nIt remains unclear how it will do so in the long term but in the short term expect more knee-jerk reactions to political events around the world.\nAnd the new look for the social network will come at a price.\nSome Ugandan officials are already accusing it of meddling in its election. Facebook could be stuck between a rock and a hard place for some time to come."},

The bulk of the workers are refugees but 18 are Kenyans from the town of Kakuma.\nGlap supplies local businesses and institutions outside the camp and even relief agencies.\n\"The agencies buy my soaps to give away to refugees who cannot afford them and for their own staff too,\" the Burundian proudly notes. \nMr Havyarimana is not the only local soap merchant, but he does not fear the competition, and in fact offers classes to teach people how to make cleaning products.\n\"I want to mentor women and younger people so they can have an opportunity to become self-reliant and improve their lives like I did,\" he says.\n\"I want to help the community in any way I can.\" \nEfforts like his may have helped keep Covid-19 at bay in Kakuma. \nThe most recent UNHCR figures, dating from 24 December, show that there had been 341 confirmed cases with 19 people under medical care. There have been 10 deaths from the virus.\nKenya has registered nearly 100,000 cases nationally, with around 1,700 deaths, health ministry figures show.\nPolitical instability and violence have forced more than 300,000 people to flee Burundi to neighbouring African countries in the last decade, according to the UNHCR.\nMr Havyarimana was in the middle of his chemistry studies at the University of Burundi when he left. He says his life was in danger and that he was receiving death threats from relatives of his late mother, who also seized his home.\nAfter arriving in Kakuma, he wanted to make money for himself, rather than relying on humanitarian aid.\nThe camp sits in an isolated and arid region where the provision of basic services is a challenge for relief agencies. \nExploring the region, Mr Havyarimana noticed there was not a soap factory, which meant that cleaning products had to be brought from elsewhere.\n\"I had no idea of how to make soap, so I started surfing the web for some knowledge,\" he explains.\nHe later enrolled in a soap-making course offered by the World Lutheran Federation aid agency, and with a loan from a former classmate in Burundi, he started the business alongside two helpers.\nHe also received grants from relief agencies including the UNHCR and NGOs such as the African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC), which says it has supported more then 18,000 refugee entrepreneurs.\n\"Innocent's story shows how refugees can contribute to their host communities in a number of ways,\" Julienne Oyler, the AEC's chair, tells the BBC.\n\"Camps like Kakuma are so isolated that entrepreneurs like him are a lifeline to basic goods and services at a time of lockdowns and other restrictions.\"\nA 2018 World Bank study identified over 2,000 businesses in Kakuma and estimated that they contributed more than $50m (\u00a337m) to the local economy every year.\nMichelle Richey, a lecturer in technology and entrepreneurship at the UK's Loughborough University specialising in refugee business ventures, says people like Mr Havyarimana are very import in changing the general perception of refugees.\n\"The human potential within refugees shows when we give them chances to work instead of just focusing on humanitarian issues,\" she says.\n\"We can help those people have some control of their lives again after all they have been through.\"\nStarting a thriving business is not the only change in Mr Havyarimana's life since arriving in Kakuma. In 2017, he married Aline, a fellow Burundian refugee he met at the camp. \nThey have two sons, and the youngest one, Prince, was born in late November. \nMr Havyarimana speaks with fondness about life in Kenya but he dreams of being resettled in Australia or Canada. \n\"I like Kakuma a lot, but I want to give my wife and kids a better life,\" he says.\nIn the meantime, Mr Havyarimana is focusing on expanding his ways to help the community, and as well as offering 21 kinds of soap and cleaning products, he has devised a hand sanitiser created from aloe vera grown in a patch just outside his workshop.\n\"Coronavirus has affected the whole world but for us here in Kakuma, it has made it even more important that we clean our hands in any we can,\" he says."},

Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony.\nThis is the second time Democrats have pursued impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nIn December 2019, the House impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020.\nNo US president has ever been impeached twice.\nHowever, the prospect of an impeachment conviction is unlikely because of Mr Trump's broad Republican support in the Senate.\nThe resolution drafted by three Democrats - who began writing it while under lockdown in the Capitol last Wednesday - consists of one article: \"Incitement of insurrection\".\n\"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,\" the resolution reads.\nIn the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in \"imminent lawless action at the Capitol\".\nThe resolution also says this was \"consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct\" the certification of President-elect Biden's election win.\n\"He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,\" the resolution says.\nImpeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial.\nArticles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial to decide whether to convict or not. There is no appeal against outcome.\nAn impeachment is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nMr Trump was the third US president to be impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were also left in office by the Senate.\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached in 1974, as political pressure built over the Watergate scandal.\nOn Monday, the Democrats presented a resolution to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president and the cabinet to declare Mr Trump unfit for office.\nThe resolution urged Mr Pence to \"declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the president is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office\".\nBut, as expected, the resolution was not adopted by unanimous consent in the House, after Republican Alex Mooney of West Virginia objected to the request.\nThe House has now gone into recess until Tuesday morning, when the chamber is expected to vote on the resolution.\nAfter the vote, the Democrats said they will give Mr Pence 24 hours to remove Mr Trump from office before they move toward impeachment.\n\"The president's threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,\" Speaker Pelosi said.\nAlthough Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment.\nImpeachments are usually long, drawn-out affairs, involving investigations and hearings that can take weeks to conclude. This impeachment is expected to be much quicker. \nMonday's presentation of the impeachment article to the House paves the way for a vote to be held. A simple majority in favour of impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Senate.\nHowever, an internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires.\nThe Senate is currently not in session, and all 100 senators would have to agree to change the schedule, which is highly unlikely.\nConstitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial when Mr Trump leaves office. But Democrats appear confident that the House can impeach Mr Trump and send the articles to the Senate for a trial at a later date.\nOn Sunday, Democratic House whip James Clyburn said the party may not send any articles to the Senate for trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office.\nIt's a new week in Washington DC, but the fallout from Wednesday's tragic events are just beginning.  \nWith only eight days left of Mr Trump's presidency, Democrats are very aware of the disruption an impeachment and a Senate trial would cause to the early days of Mr Biden's administration.\nThat's why there is talk of delaying Mr Trump's Senate trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office. \nAt that point, the pressure to remove Mr Trump will be past, but other punishments - stripping him of the accommodations and privileges ex-presidents enjoy and prohibiting him from future federal office - still apply.\nA year ago, Senate Republicans voted as a block to acquit the president of impeachment charges. This time, however, there may be some willing to side with Democrats to make sure that Trump, once out of power, never returns again."},

There were 112 positive cases at the 66 EFL clubs in its most recent round of testing. \nThe Football Association will be reminding everyone of their responsibilities.\nIt is understood there are no plans to halt elite sport but government ministers are concerned that the images from dressing rooms could make it harder to defend its continuation. \nA Whitehall source confirmed to the BBC that the celebrations at Chorley and Crawley Town had been noted by ministers, who last week warned football's authorities they had to do all they could to justify elite sport carrying on.\nIn his letter written to clubs on Monday, seen by BBC Sport, EFL chief executive Birch also said: \"Throughout the pandemic, football has provided a glimmer of hope for many millions of people affected by restrictions but we all understand the scrutiny the game remains under.\n\"While football is permitted to continue the actions of all participants will clearly be under the microscope. \n\"I am therefore personally asking you to re-double your efforts, to check, amend and tighten your protocol accordingly, and ensure that players and staff are left in no doubt as to their responsibilities on matchdays.\"\nProfessor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told BBC Breakfast that allowing team sports to continue was \"a balancing act\".\n\"The balancing act is trying to minimise the amount of contact outside very structured environments while trying to keep some semblance of life as will all know it,\" he said.  \n\"It is very much a matter for individuals in their day-to-day life. We have all got to say what, in our own lives, can we do to minimise the amount of impact we have on the NHS and the vulnerable?\"\nElite sport is not quite in the last-chance saloon, but the exemption it has been granted, at a time when grassroots sport has had to stop, cannot be taken for granted. \nA suspension is not yet imminent, but there are also no guarantees, especially if infection rates continue to rise, hospitals become overwhelmed, and the national lockdown has to be strengthened further. The government's patience seems to be wearing thin after the scenes of crowded dressing-room celebrations made a mockery of the social-distancing protocols that clubs were reminded of. \nThe optics of on-field hugs and handshakes, and fans gathering outside grounds, beamed into millions of homes at a time when the government is desperate for the public to stay at home and avoid contact with other households, is highly unhelpful to those making the case for professional sport to be allowed to continue. \nMy understanding is that ministers and medical experts' concerns do not amount to a final warning; they realise that the coverage of elite sport encourages people to stay at home and helps to retain some normality and balance in people's lives, and that protocols have largely been successful in suppressing transmission around training and fixtures. \nBut having warned sports bodies of their responsibilities last week, the government does now expect to see the football authorities in particular redouble their efforts, and for players' behaviour to reflect the privilege they enjoy in being able to continue to work when there has been so much disruption in so many people's work and lives. \nCertainly, football can ill afford any more high-profile breaches of the guidelines by players when away from their clubs.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the rules around celebrations in particular could be \"difficult to understand\".\n\"To control emotions when you are playing at 200mph is very difficult,\" he said on Monday.\n\"We are asking our players at corners, for example, to be man-marking people, pushing people around and not fist-bump anyone.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola voiced similar concerns, saying: \"When one guy scores a goal, I don't know if they can be controlled and not celebrate it.\n\"The joy to celebrate it, I don't know if [a player] is going to think: 'I cannot hug my mate for two, three seconds'.\"\nWolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo described the increase of cases as \"scary\".\n\"What I'm afraid of is the decision to stop - football as we know now will not be the same,\" he said.\n\"This is my biggest fear because the schedule will go crazy.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said: \"Everyone knows the situation and if it gets suspended I don't think it'd be a surprise.\n\"We'll just go with what the Government and Premier League have to say and, if it's the case to carry on, we'll carry on. But I don't think I'm being controversial if I say I don't think anyone would be surprised if we don't carry on with the way it's sweeping through the country.\"\nDespite fans not being allowed to attend matches, football still allows for some sense of escapism - a point Arteta emphasised.\n\"We know what we can bring to society if we are able to do it in safe way,\" he said.\n\"There are a lot of positives to take but it is just that balance. When we are still safe, we can add something positive without this difficult context.\""},

But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents.\nDuring the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of him stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\" \nFor this revolutionary the harvest is still not over.\nMy introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out. \nThe piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings.\nIt is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity.\nHe is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure.\nMany young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language).\nBut the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around. \nIn his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the last election, he has been traversing the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets.\nAnd with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni has been keen to show his vitality. Last April, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November. \n\"If your father loves you, he has to empower you. In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern.\nThe economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power.\nOne of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty. \n\"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says.\n\"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent\u2026 he is an Africanist.\"\nNevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005.\nIndeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm.\nJournalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life.\n\"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote.\nBut something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits. \nHe had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age. \nAnd then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building. \nMany saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life.\nIt is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president. \nThe significance of patronage extends right through society.\nIt sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution.\nBut his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years.\n\"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council.\nWhile acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\".\nDespite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority.\nThe judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government. \nWhen judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.\nFor example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. \n\"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple.\nWhen it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment.\nThe media has also had its independence threatened.\nOn the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni. \n\"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala.\nBut outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds.\nBut perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered.\nAs it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents.\nKizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, once Mr Museveni's physician, first ran against him in the 2001 election. He has been detained and prosecuted on numerous charges, including rape and treason, but has never been convicted.\nNow that Bobi Wine, a singer whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is mounting a serious challenge to the president's rule, he has become the latest politician to face the wrath of the men in uniform.\nThe MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped. \nOn the campaign trail for this election, the police have arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups.\nDuring two days of protests in November following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces.\nSticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face.\nThrough his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control. He has also managed to reinvent himself. \nWhereas he was once the political upstart in his early 40s, anyone taking on that role now risks incurring his considerable wrath."},

{"title": "How Mexico is reclaiming spirulina", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20210111-how-mexico-is-reclaiming-spirulina", "tag": "travel", "tag2": "story", "author": "Nicholas DeRenzo", "article_text": "\nIf you've spent any time dining in Mexico City recently, you may have noticed spirulina cropping up on menus in everything from the usual smoothies to more traditional dishes such as tortillas and \ntlayudas\n (a crisp tortilla base with refried beans and other toppings). But don't assume this is some symbol of encroaching hipster health food globalisation: in fact, centuries before it was deemed a \"superfood\", the vibrantly coloured cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae) \u2013 which grows primarily in warm alkaline lakes, ponds and rivers in the tropics and subtropics \u2013 was a pre-Hispanic dietary staple.\nThe Mexica \u2013 or Aztecs, as they were later known \u2013 harvested the protein-rich substance from the surface of Lake Texcoco, an expansive body of water in central Mexico that was later largely drained by the Spanish to make way for the construction of Mexico City. Here, the waters exhibited the perfect balance of salinity and alkalinity for spirulina to flourish. The Mexica called the foodstuff \ntecuitlatl\n, a Nahuatl word that roughly translates to \"rock excrement\", though they held it in decidedly higher esteem than its name suggests.\n\"Oral traditions say that the Mexica couriers and runners in ancient Tenochtitlan would eat dried spirulina cakes with corn, tortillas, beans, chillies or mole as fuel for long-distance travel,\" said Denise Vallejo, an indigenous first-generation Xicana chef who runs the vegan Los Angeles pop-up \nAlchemy Organica\n.\nEven without modern science, the Mexica could recognise the nutrient density that has made spirulina such a favourite today. It boasts about 60-70% protein by weight and has essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals, especially iron, manganese and B vitamins, according to the Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements. It's so healthy and relatively easy to grow, in fact, that \nexperts think it could be a potential food source for future Mars colonies\n.\nOf course, to the arriving Spanish conquistadors in the 16th Century, it mostly just looked odd. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo wrote in his 1568 memoir about \"a species of bread made of a kind of mud or slime collected from the surface of the lake, and eaten in that form, and has a similar taste to our cheese.\" And Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan included illustrations of spirulina harvesting in his 16th-Century ethnographic study, the Florentine Codex.\n\"After the Spanish invasion, most of its consumption declined with the draining of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico,\" Vallejo said. \"And many of the Spanish didn't enjoy its 'cheesy' or 'slimy' properties. Knowledge of its consumption was lost for a long time.\"\nThe Western world rediscovered the nutritious ingredient in the 1940s, when a French phycologist (a scientist who studies algae) noticed the Kanembu people along Africa's Lake Chad harvesting spirulina and turning it into sun-dried cakes called \ndih\u00e9\n. But it didn't make its grand return to Mexico until a happy accident in the 1960s, when the owners of Sosa Texcoco \u2013 which produced sodium carbonate and calcium chloride in a large snail-shaped pond on the remnants of Lake Texcoco \u2013 noticed a green substance mucking up the works. They reached out to French researchers, who concluded that it was the same organism that had been nourishing the Kanembu for generations. Rather than try to eradicate the cyanobacteria, Sosa Texcoco recognized its value, encouraged its growth and opened the world's first commercial spirulina company, Spirulina Mexicana.\nWhile Spirulina Mexicana has since closed, a micro-farm on the outskirts of San Miguel de Allende called \nSpirulina Viva\n is continuing the ancient tradition. Since 2010, American expat Katie Kohlstedt and her San Luis Potos\u00ed-born husband, Francisco Portillo, have grown fresh spirulina that probably tastes remarkably similar to what the Mexica harvested centuries ago. \"We're really proud to grow it here,\" she said. \"We didn't have to invent something new or bring something from somewhere else.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\n\u2022 \nMexico's ancient caviar\n\u2022 \nWhere there's no queso in quesadilla\n\u2022 \nMexico City's walking fish\nWhile many people may be familiar with spirulina in its dehydrated powdered form, Spirulina Viva sells the green stuff raw and frozen, which imparts a much more delicate flavour. \"Fresh spirulina should be creamy like a spreadable cheese,\" Kohlstedt said. \"If you closed your eyes, you might think you were eating a cross between an avocado and spinach.\" She noted that if you think of spirulina as fishy or an acquired taste, chances are you've been buying a lesser-quality product \u2013 or even one that uses ground fish bones to provide the phosphorus the spirulina needs to grow.\nKohlstedt and Portillo lead spirulina-growing workshops and have welcomed future farmers from as far away as Australia and Argentina. \"It's gardening combined with chemistry,\" Kohlstedt said of the process. But for many consumers, the finished product still remains a bit of a mystery. \"If I read one more article that said spirulina is grown in the ocean or [that shows] a picture of seaweed, I'm just going to scream,\" she said, with a laugh. \"My other two least favourite words are 'pond scum'. I think that's really offensive actually!\"\nKohlstedt recommends eating spirulina as simply as possible, stirred into warm miso soup or bone broth, blended into a smoothie, spread on bread or mixed into guacamole with extra lime juice, because vitamin C has been shown to help iron absorption. \"You're going to feel like you just ate Popeye's lunch,\" she said.\nIn Mexico City, chefs are getting even more creative with the ingredient. You might find spirulina dusting a tlayuda topped with avocado and \nescamoles \n(ant larvae) at \nBalc\u00f3n del Z\u00f3calo\n; brightening a superfood tortilla at \nCintli Tortilleria\n; adding a verdant punch to the smoothie bowls and cheesecakes at \nVegamo\n; and even spiking cocktails at the pre-Hispanic-inspired \nXam\na\nn Bar\n.\nThere, head bartender Kenneth Rodrigez has incorporated spirulina into a number of drinks, including a gin-based cocktail with Mexican lime and asparagus liqueur. \"I use it when somebody doesn't like egg whites or [in drinks for] vegan people, because spirulina has protein and we can get interesting textures,\" Rodrigez said, \"not to mention the incredible colour and the nutritional components that it provides.\"\u00a0\nHe describes the taste notes as \"green, herbal and \nclorofila \n(chlorophyll),\" and said that \"it can be used to enhance other flavours, because it has lots of minerals, like an alternative for salt.\"\u00a0\nAcross the border in Mexican American communities, using spirulina has meant establishing a direct connection with a pre-Hispanic past. At San Antonio's inventive Mexican restaurant \nMixtli\n, for instance, chefs Rico Torres and Diego Galicia featured spirulina on a special menu inspired by the Spanish conquest, and they participated in a collaborative D\u00eda de los Muertos dinner at New York's \nJames\nBeard House\n, where one of the hors d'oeuvres was a smoked spirulina yogurt with trout roe and radishes.\nAt Alchemy Organica, Vallejo incorporates spirulina powder into a pineapple \nagua fresca\n (a Mexican drink made with water, sugar and pureed fruits, seeds, flowers or grains for flavour) with lime and chia seeds. And she has even used it as \"a natural food colouring and nutritional boost, along with cactus and spinach powders\" to make vibrant green \nmasa\n (dough made with corn that has been nixtamalized, or treated with an alkaline solution), which she turns into colourful tortillas and tamales. \"I also use it as a flavour enhancer for some of my seafood-inspired dishes, as it imparts a flavour much like seaweed,\" she explained.\u00a0\nAnd when one of her cooks began selling fresh spirulina at a farmer's market, Vallejo took to simply scooping spoonfuls into her drinks. \"It gives you energy like you'd expect from a cup of coffee!\" she said.\nIn a sense, these chefs are tapping into something much deeper than simply taste or nutrition. Vallejo, who studies \ncuranderismo \n(folk medicine), said that spirulina is often viewed as a detoxifier to prepare for rituals, spells and \"visionary plant ceremonies\". And Kohlstedt has similarly heard about the ingredient's mystical connections, which draw on the similarities between spirulina's helical shape and our own building blocks as humans: \"Someone told me that the reason it's called 'spirulina' has to do with its spiral form, but that it also has to do with our DNA and how there is something really basic and spiritual about how we relate to plants [and cyanobacteria].\"\n\"So many of the 'superfoods' enjoyed today have a rich history in Mesoamerica: chia, amaranth, cacao, avocado, cactus,\" Vallejo noted. \"I think the current decolonising movement in Xicanx, Central American and other Spanish-speaking communities is helping us to rediscover and remember our ancestral foodways. We get to take back our foods and our plant wisdom.

Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it.\nBluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features.\nRaising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well.\nWi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in. \nConnecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers.\nUsing a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale.\nWorldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, \n.\nSmartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia.\nTaiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step.\nBut some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough.\nAs principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks.\nHe says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems. \n\"I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely.\"\nThere is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability. \n\"Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,\" he says.\nAnother challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi. \n\"Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,\" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks.\n\"The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,\" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly. \nOne solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection.\nIt can also be tricky to install smart locks.\nYale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws. \nHelpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky.\n\"I'm a bit of a door nerd now,\" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks.\nFor fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy. \nOne workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether. \nA server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. \"The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,\" she says. \nLock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens. \nSome want an \"active command and control experience\" using Siri or Alexa. \nBut others long for locks to \"do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,\" he says.\nIf we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in.\nThey can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.\nIf you, or someone you know, are affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) "},

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Atlanta and Feud: Bette and Joan. \nThe Sex Pistols electrified British music and, depending on who you believed, threatened the very fabric of society at the tail end of the 1970s. \nThey may only have survived for two years, but their angry, nihilistic singles and violent performances changed the idea of what rock and roll could be. \nOriginally formed in 1972 by Jones and drummer Paul Cook, they were galvanized by the addition of John Lydon - aka Johnny Rotten - whose abrasive vocals and anti-establishment lyrics defined the band and, to a large extent, the British punk movement.\nThey only released one album, but the sheer sonic force of songs like Anarchy In The UK, God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant became symbols of Britain's social and political turmoil, as youth unemployment soared, with young people particularly affected.\nNot that everyone was impressed by the Sex Pistols' curious combination of anger and apathy. \nTheir singles were blacklisted on the British charts and a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying their album cover. Facing bans across the UK, the group had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. - \"Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly\".\nAlways on the verge of chaos, they finally split up on a US tour in 1978. \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" a tired and disillusioned Johnny Rotten asked the audience at their final show - but their legacy was ensured.\n\"Imagine breaking into the world of The Crown and Downton Abbey with your mates and screaming your songs and your fury at all they represent,\" said Boyle, announcing his new project. \n\"This is the moment that British society and culture changed forever. It is the detonation point for British street culture... where ordinary young people had the stage and vented their fury and their fashion\u2026and everyone had to watch and listen\".\nThe series is based on Steve Jones's memoir, Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol; which doesn't just focus on his time with the band.\nIt begins in West London, where the young musician suffered maternal neglect and sexual abuse by a step-father, and quickly fell into crime - including an attempt to climb the chimneys of Battersea Power Station, and stealing amps from a David Bowie gig.\nAfter becoming entranced by the glam rock scene, he is taken under the wings of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who helped form, style and promote the Sex Pistols.\nThe book demystifies the band behind the myth - showing how they struggled with the criticisms lobbed their way and the pressure of living up to their image, including the moment Jones was goaded into swearing live on primetime TV.\nLater chapters deal with his battles with addiction, and his recent reinvention as a tee-total \"semi-retired sexual deviant who doesn't really act out so much any more\".\nBritish-born, Australian-raised actor Toby Wallace will play Jones, following eye-catching roles in the coming-of-age drama Babyteeth and Netflix drama The Society, where he played evil teen Campbell Elliot.\nAnson Boon, last seen in the Kate Winslet tear-jerker Blackbird takes on the spittle-flecked role of Johnny Rotten; while out-of-control bassist Sid Vicious will be played by Louis Partridge.\nSydney Chandler - daughter of film star Kyle - will become Pretenders star Chrissie Hynde, who had an affair with Jones at the height of the Sex Pistols' fame.\nThe Witcher's Emma Appleton is cast as Nancy Spungen, the American girlfriend of Sid Vicious, who died in mysterious circumstances in October 1978.\nAnd Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams plays \"the face of punk\", the iconoclastic model and actress Pamela Rooke, whose signature style - ripped fishnets, dominatrix heels and raccoon-like eye make-up - defined the scene.\nThe Sex Pistols project isn't the only musical series in the pipeline.

The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals.\nPCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment.\nA series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity.\nThe chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea.\nPCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises.\nOne killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded.\nAlthough levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely.\nPCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life. \nA recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a \"cocktail of pollutants\", which are passed down from mother to calf.\nScientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain.\nIn humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality.\nStrandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast.\nThe deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections.\nIn the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades.\nThe study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility.\n\"Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,\" said Rosie Williams.\nPopulations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility.\n\"This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,\" she said.\n\"That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals.\"\nThere are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber.\nThe study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.\nFollow Helen on \n."},

I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual.\nBut then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read. \nWith a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now.\nParler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too.\nTechnology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons.\n\"Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,\" she said.\nIt's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too.\nAgain, this is not unheard of. \nGab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days.\nWhat is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president.\nSince Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch.\nYouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance.\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as \"problematic\".\nEU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as \"the 9/11 moment of social media\", \n that \"the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing\".\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now \"taking editorial decisions\", adding that platforms were \"choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice\".\nElsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship.\nHe tweeted: \"The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship.\"\nThe fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter.\nOne of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse.\nPlatforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies.\nBut since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders.\nIn March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation.\nIt wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence.\nThe president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\".\nSocial media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets \"a pivotal precedent\" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post.\nSome analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide.\nOn Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election.\nPrivacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants. \n\"Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world.

On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021.\nBBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch.\nThe fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation.\nA recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground.\nVaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than\nfirst doses had been administered. \nBut some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses.\nMuch of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order.\nGermany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. \nMr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand.\nGermany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer.\nThe Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager.\nBut the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. \"We believed when we contributed \u20ac12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,\" he told a newspaper this week.\nThe country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to \n people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. \nIt has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature.\nHowever, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer.\nFrance's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to \n - still so small as to be statistically meaningless.  \nSo why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used.\nThe primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. \nEach recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives.\nAnother problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers.\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings.\nPolitically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a \"state scandal\", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free.\nRussia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity.\nSputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded.\nA poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week that \n had been vaccinated.\nBut one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown.\nRussia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped.\nAlmost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is still \nof how many others have received the vaccination. \nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains \"feasible\". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. \nAlongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February.\nSwedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine.\nA successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. \nMeanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands.\nIt seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further \nelderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial.\nThe mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be \"seamless and fast\", tweeting: \"If that does not work, shoot me.\"\nThe first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September.\nYou may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed.\nAfter getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its \"careful\" approach.\nAnd there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. \nIn a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least.\nSpain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with \npeople vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. \nEach of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. \nGovernment data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. \nAlthough vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination.\nHowever, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. \nThe arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by \"political affiliations or parliamentary needs\", a claim the central government has rejected.

But it says the design has \"great potential\".\nOne day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet.\nIn traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky.\nUnder a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload.\nMaveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\"There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,\" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant.\n\"We believe that we have to go into a really\u2026 breakthrough technology,\" she says.\nAn equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.\nResearchers there are working on a design known as the \"Flying-V\". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350.\nLike Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves.\nThe designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be \"plugged\" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once.\n\"We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,\" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology.\nThe design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany.\nThe flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success.\nResearchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as \"Dutch roll\". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as \"a somewhat rough landing\" that damaged the front landing gear.\nData from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator.\nAirlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V.\nThe attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact.\nBut with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as \"showstoppers\".\nAmong them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency.\nThere's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the \"wing\" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal.\nBuilding a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region.\n\"That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,\" says Mr Wright.\nAirbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer.\nIts rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing.\nAircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier.\nBoeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design.\nBut current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at \n - are based on proving that concept.\nFor longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power.\nOne major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane.\nBut the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities.\nThose priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion.\nAirbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power.\nIn September, Airbus \n.\nHydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing.\nBut there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide.\nIn order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution.\n\"Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,\" he explains."},

For nearly five years, she willingly paid the city's premium rents and taxes, while commuting to work in another state.\nBut the pandemic wore her down.\n\"I was like, 'The city's going to come back. By July, it's going to be ok.' But it just kept not being ok,\" she says.\n\"I wasn't planning on leaving at all,\" she adds. \"It was a complete switch.\"\nSince March, property firms and moving companies have reported a rush of demand from people leaving New York, many of them young families, as the pandemic drives demand for bigger homes and more outdoor space, while making relocation easier by expanding remote work.\nAnd so far, the surge hasn't shown signs of slowing, says Liz Nunan, president of property firm Houlihan Lawrence, which handles home sales in suburbs around New York City, and reported its best year on record in 2020.\n\"One of the things I learned in 2020 is that I have no idea what the future holds, but I feel rather bullish on 2021,\" she says. \"I believe we'll have a year that's nearly as strong as 2020 turned out to be.\"\nLast year, longer distance relocations from New York City helped push New York the state to the biggest population decline of any in the US, putting it on track for its first population fall of any decade since the 1970s. \nThe signs of outflow have spawned a small universe of articles debating whether New York City is dead or dying, and what - if anything - should be done to help it recover. \nAnd as the US confronts an economic crisis likely to outlast the pandemic that precipitated it, such concerns are not unique to the US's largest city.\nSmaller downtowns across the country have watched in despair as signs of long-sought revival - new restaurants, businesses in formerly abandoned buildings - disappear almost overnight.\n\"This is a difficult time for everybody,\" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank. \"The real issue is: can these cities hold their economic vitality?\" \nIn New York, the pandemic has closed theatres, emptied offices, halted tourism, and turned shopping and dining into hazards to be undertaken at your own risk, gutting industries that employed a fifth of the city's workforce.\nAs many as a third of the city's small businesses may not survive the pandemic, according to estimates by local business group, the Partnership for New York City. Most companies in the city's downtown do not expect staff to ever return to the office in full force. Some firms have already left.\nThe situation has \n - almost double the national average - swollen the ranks of the homeless, and helped spur the departure of more than 300,000 people like Andrea, further straining public finances.\nIn response, New York leaders have raised the prospect of increasing taxes and cutting services like transportation, garbage collection and park maintenance, while begging for emergency aid from Washington to resolve financial woes - pleas that so far have fallen on deaf ears.\nMichael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at the free market Manhattan Institute think tank, worries the potential cuts will further accelerate the outflow, hurting the very amenities that make city life attractive and leaving a poorer city for those who remain.\n\"It's not really so much the pandemic that is the greatest challenge to New York City,\" he says. \"It's really the second order consequences that have dealt a blow to the city's recovery and its citizens.\n\"New York is not dead, but it is on life support,\" he says. \"Whether its recovery is measured in months or years or decades is primarily determined by the degree of leadership that we see in the city. And I think that's why we should be so concerned.\"\nIn some ways, such worries are uniquely American, reflecting the safety woes and weak educational systems that set so many US cities apart from counterparts in Europe and Canada, says Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto. He predicts that coronavirus outflow from cities outside the US will be less dramatic and more temporary.\nIn the US, however, the urban revival of the early 2000s had shown signs of fading even before the pandemic, as immigration waned and moves to the suburbs accelerated. \nIn New York, the population has been falling since 2016.\nThe expansion of remote work caused by the pandemic means the city is now competing with even more places for businesses and families - trends that are unlikely to fully reverse even after life returns to normal, Prof Florida says.\n\"Talented people have choice now with remote work. Those choices will be made carefully,\" he says. \"The big winners are places with a lot of amenity, and the premium for amenity will grow. That means cities with wonderful coast lines or rural areas near mountains. Places like Miami Beach, or Bozeman, Montana, or Aspen, Colorado, or the Hudson Valley of New York.\" \nAndrea, who initially decamped to her mother's home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says she hasn't entirely written off New York. But for now, she's planning a cross-country road trip, working remotely while scoping out new cities to potentially call home.  \n\"I'm going to hop in the car\u2026 and drive around the country, and see if anything feels like a fit,\" she says. \"If it doesn't, then I'll see where the world is in September.\"\nKevin Pearsall and his wife left New York City in March for Atlanta, Georgia. After years of focusing on their careers in advertising, the 35-year-old says they wanted a hometown where they didn't feel like housing and other living costs remained a stretch - even on their healthy six-figure salaries.\nThey both landed jobs as remote workers for New York firms - another sign that convinced them the city was no longer the only place they could combine professional opportunity and social life.\n\"All of the great things about New York - speakeasies, beer gardens... that's not really as unique as it used to be,\" he says.\n\"We were already in motion, thinking about leaving,\" he says. The pandemic \"just accelerated\" the move.\nNew York leaders have expressed confidence that the city will remain a draw, noting that outflow of a few hundred thousand hardly makes a dent in a city of more than eight million. \n\"I'm not going to beg people to stay,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last year. \"I know this city will rebound. I know it. And I know others will come. They have for generations.\" \n\"We can't overrate this moment in history,\" he added. \"It is a passing moment. There will be a vaccine. And then all the strengths of New York City will reassert again.\"\nHow it will shake out in the long term remains a question.\nThe neighbourhoods that emptied during lockdowns last year were the city's wealthiest, but a Manhattan Institute survey this summer found that \n with dissatisfaction highest among those with lower incomes.\nMr Hendrix says it is tempting to hope a more affordable city will emerge if the rich depart, but he worries such an exodus will generate still more challenges, given how dependent the city is on high earners for tax revenue.\n\"It doesn't take a majority leaving the city or a majority changing their lifestyle to make a big difference,\" he says.\n is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nProf Florida says the biggest cities, like New York and San Francisco, are likely to remain a draw for young people, who should benefit if rents continue to fall. \nBut he warns that such declines were short-lived after previous crises.

In this image, the oil paintings of political figures in the background emphasise this imagery of the past.\nThere have been renewed calls for the Confederate flag to be banned across the US following the anti-racism protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, a black man.\nHowever Mr Trump has defended use of the flag, calling it a matter of free speech.\nOne man in a Trump beanie here walks between the red guide ropes, as many visitors might do on a guided-tour to view the Crypt, the Statuary Hall and the Rotunda.\nBut this man is carrying a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, as he poses in front of a painting depicting the surrender of Gen Burgoyne in the war of independence. \nAnother man, identified as Jake Angeli, an ardent Trump supporter who has attended a number of the president's rallies, shouts as he makes his way to the Senate Chamber. \nHis incongruous garments set him apart from other protesters wearing black hoodies. These Trump activists stand by taking selfies, but he has clearly come here to be photographed by others.\nThe apparent lack of a security presence is in sharp contrast to other Washington protests where there is a highly visible presence of heavily armed security forces protecting US institutions.\nAnother Trump supporter, identified as Richard Barnett, sits with one boot disrespectfully on a desk that is at the very centre of power in Congress. It is in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \nIn the scene, unimaginable days earlier, Barnett in his baseball cap and checked shirt resembles a raconteur regaling friends with tales of his exploits. \nThe image went viral as did pictures of the notes he and others left on Ms Pelosi's desk.\nThis dramatic image shows how the formal proceedings came to a violent halt as Capitol police officers drew their guns on doors being attacked by protesters intent on entering the House Chamber.\nMany commentators asked if they were watching a coup unfold as doors were barricaded and firearms brandished.\nThe composition is reminiscent of a scene in a Hollywood Western, the lawmen bracing for the doors to be breached.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden made an impassioned TV address describing the scenes as \"an assault on democracy\" - this chilling picture encapsulates what he meant.

Mr Wolf last week called on Mr Trump to \"strongly condemn\" the protesters who stormed Congress.\nThe outgoing secretary said his departure had been prompted by \"recent events\", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment.\nLaw enforcement around the country are said to be bracing for the possibility of further violence in the days before Joe Biden takes office. \nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.   \n around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. \nCalls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots.\nLocal police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses following last week's violence, according to US media. \nThe Reuters news agency, citing a federal law enforcement official, said the FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. \nAlthough the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were reported elsewhere in the country at the same time.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday that it would begin National Special Security Event (NSSE) operations for the inauguration six days early, starting Wednesday.\nThe designation allows a wide range of security and law enforcement agencies to coordinate together on special protective measures, like enforcing road closures and a secure perimeter.\nThe announcement came after Washington DC's Mayor, Ms Bowser, went public with her appeal to bolster security after what she described as an \"unprecedented terrorist attack\" at the US Capitol last week.\nShe has also asked Americans to avoid travel to Washington DC for the event. Inaugurations traditionally draw hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital, but the coronavirus pandemic had already curtailed those plans before security fears were heightened. \nThe Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, said Monday that 10,000 troops will be in Washington DC by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested by local officials.\nElsewhere, the National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid \"credible threats\" of further violence.  \n\"Groups involved in the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol continue to threaten to disrupt the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20,\" the service said in a statement, adding it could institute further temporary closures to other areas within the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \nSpeaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was \"not afraid\" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears.\nHis inauguration committee has announced that the ceremony will be themed around \"America United\". \nAfter being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. \nDonald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years not to do so.\nThe warnings about further pro-Trump violence come as efforts move forward to impeach the president for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol.\nAn article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" during a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was \"stolen\" from him. \nDemocrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office.\nMr Trump has made no public statements since \n - on Friday.\nIt comes as websites and social media networks crackdown against other users and websites seen to be encouraging violence - including social network Parler, \n.

The 76-year-old faces 10 challengers, most notably the pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine. \nHuman rights groups have accused security forces of using excessive force to break up opposition rallies during the campaign. But the government says the strong measures are necessary to ensure people comply with a ban on large crowds imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nHere are the five things you need to know about the crucial vote:\nPresident Museveni is one of the longest-serving presidents in Africa. He and his National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986 at the end of a five-year war, and have led Uganda ever since.\nHis supporters praise him for bringing relative peace and prosperity to the country, and in particular for his policies on health. He helped limit the spread of HIV, and more recently his harsh lockdown - which closed schools and business, banned vehicle movement and imposed mandatory public mask use in May - is credited with tackling the coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to Johns Hopkins University, \n and around just 300 deaths from the illness.\nBut while he was once hailed in the West as one of the new generation of African leaders, his critics accuse him of turning into another authoritarian leader. \nMr Museveni has no designated successor within his party, and in 2017 \n allowing him to run again for the presidency. \nHe has seen off a number of challengers to his rule over the years, notably long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was arrested numerous times and decided not to run again for the presidency in 2021. \nWhile Mr Museveni maintains a large support base, especially in rural areas, he is facing increasing opposition over rising inequality and his rigid control over the country.\nOne of 10 candidates challenging him for the presidency this year is musician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known by the stage name Bobi Wine. \nAffectionately referred to as the \"ghetto president\", the 38-year-old became an East African musical superstar in the early 2000s before switching to politics and winning a seat in parliament in 2017.\nBobi Wine is seen as the biggest challenge to Mr Museveni's rule and has mobilised many young people who have not previously been involved in politics. He has sharply criticised the president in the past and accused him of \"fearing the people\".\nThe president has not taken this challenge lightly. He has accused Bobi Wine of being a foreign agent of those \"who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda\" and said that opposition figures are misleading young people to get involved in violence on the campaign trail. \nBobi Wine has been arrested several times since he became involved in politics. He has spoken of a \"revolution\" against Mr Museveni. \n using the hashtag \"WeAreRemovingADictator\".\nPart of Bobi Wine's popularity comes down to his age. At 38, he is just half as old as President Museveni, in one of the youngest nations on earth. \n Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide, of just 15.7 - only Niger is younger. \nThe \"ghetto president\" grew up in a slum in the capital, Kampala. His background and his efforts to promote social justice in his country through his music and as a politician have endeared him to this younger, more urban generation. \nBut Bobi Wine has also surprised authorities by drawing big crowds of supporters in rural areas - thought to be a bastion of support for President Museveni.\nTensions are high, and the campaign has been marred by serious violence, which has left dozens killed and hundreds more arrested. \nOfficials have cited measures brought in to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic for their efforts to break up political gatherings. But \n that security forces are using these regulations \"as a pretext to violate rights and clamp down on the opposition and the media\". \n for allegedly breaching Covid measures. His detention sparked protest which led to a wave of arrests and left dozens dead, mostly allegedly shot by the security forces.\nAfterwards, \n and said \"police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence\".\n\"Can I repeat? Police have a right to shoot you and you die for nothing.... do it at your own risk.\"\nBobi Wine has since taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest and helmet on the campaign trail. \nAt the end of last year he halted his campaign after a number of his team were injured as security forces dispersed one of his political rallies. He later told broadcaster CNN he had survived several assassination attempts. \nA country of more than 42 million people, Uganda is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nIt has one of the highest refugee populations worldwide, hosting \n from neighbouring countries. \nSome are watching the political unrest in the country with concern, and worry about what could happen after the vote. There has never been a peaceful transfer of power in Uganda and it is not clear what would happen if Mr Museveni were to lose, and what the military would do.\nThe president announced a shake-up of the armed forces in November, bringing in the former head of Uganda's operations in Somalia, Maj Gen Paul Lokech, as deputy inspector general of police to coordinate security forces around the capital during the election period. \nThe European Union has chosen not to send observers to the election this year - reportedly because \n to make polling more fair - meaning there will be less international scrutiny.

The opposition says this is because it is popular in those areas, but the government says the measure is due to Covid-19 restrictions. \n\"We found this network to be linked to the government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda,\" Facebook said in a statement. \n\"They used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were,\" the statement continued. \nBut government spokesman Ofwono Opondo hit back in a \n, accusing Facebook of failing to adhere to \"natural justice\" and echoing suggestions by other government figures that the social network is trying to influence the election outcome. \n\"We are not familiar with anybody who complains about these accounts,\" he said. \"The owners have not received any notice and no-one was asked to make any response to the allegations.\"\nMr Opondo described Facebook as high-handed. \"I think they are playing the usual games,\" he added. \"We know that they have a side in this election perhaps.\" \nThe government spokesman said Thursday's elections would be free and fair.\nThe BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that the campaign period has been dominated by social media, as political parties moved to reach a young, politically aware population.\nMany new accounts promoting messages from both the ruling party and the opposition have popped up in the last couple of months, especially on Facebook and Twitter. In many cases, the users did not use proper names, and shared content filled with hate messages and fake news, she says. \nUgandans online have said saying that the government has finally got a taste of what it feels like to be censured.\nIn December, the Uganda Communications Commission, the media industry regulator, wrote to Google, asking it to shut down several YouTube channels associated with Bobi Wine.\nIn the past, the government body has ordered online content creators such as influencers and bloggers to register and have their material vetted before publication, but this was put on hold after it was challenged in court. \nDuring the 2016 election, the government blocked social media on polling day and for several after, which led to the proliferation of VPN use in the country.\nIt feels like there is a fresh wind blowing through social media in terms of how it deals with political content.\nFirst we saw US President Donald Trump banned from Twitter and Facebook and now that has been extended beyond the US to Africa. \nFacebook has shut a slew of accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials, accusing them of \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\" in the public debate ahead of Thursday's election.\nMark Zuckerberg has long insisted that the platform he founded has to allow all forms of free speech and cannot become an arbiter of political conversations.\nSo what has changed? The truth is that the platform has increasingly focused on misinformation in recent years but the violence and chaos witnessed at the heart of the US government in recent days have forced it to speed up these attempts, and make some pretty big decisions.\nThe days of describing itself as a mere conduit for content seem to be well and truly over.\nIt has tried lots of ways to reduce misinformation, including ranking reliable journalism higher than fake news and training algorithms to identify \"bad\" posts, but it has had mixed results.\nBut now with all eyes on it, it is going to have to find a way to deal with content in a way that pleases politicians, its users and its advertisers, who do not want to be associated with a platform that is being accused of inciting unrest or influencing the results of elections.\nIt remains unclear how it will do so in the long term but in the short term expect more knee-jerk reactions to political events around the world.\nAnd the new look for the social network will come at a price.\nSome Ugandan officials are already accusing it of meddling in its election. Facebook could be stuck between a rock and a hard place for some time to come."},

So I lowered the prices, as it was more important to protect people than to think of profit,\" the 35-year-old tells the BBC.\n\"I had to increase my production by 75% to meet the demand when the pandemic started, so Covid-19 has been good for my business.\n\"But I made sure I gave free soap to vulnerable people such as the elderly and the disabled.\"\nMr Havyarimana's initiative has been praised by the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, which often highlights the contribution of refugee entrepreneurs to their host communities.\n\"The refugees are playing a pivotal role in helping contain the spread of Covid-19 in Kakuma,\" Eujin Byun, a spokesperson for UNHCR in Kenya tells the BBC.\n\"They helped in many ways, from disseminating information about the virus to helping people take the necessary measures.\"\nShe added that she was not surprised by Mr Havyarimana's decision to lower prices.\n\"Refugees are very community-oriented and they will look after each other. They have previously stepped up and helped us do our jobs in situations like that.\"\nMr Havyarimana currently employs 42 people in his business, named Glap Industries - short for God Loves All People. The bulk of the workers are refugees but 18 are Kenyans from the town of Kakuma.\nGlap supplies local businesses and institutions outside the camp and even relief agencies.\n\"The agencies buy my soaps to give away to refugees who cannot afford them and for their own staff too,\" the Burundian proudly notes. \nMr Havyarimana is not the only local soap merchant, but he does not fear the competition, and in fact offers classes to teach people how to make cleaning products.\n\"I want to mentor women and younger people so they can have an opportunity to become self-reliant and improve their lives like I did,\" he says.\n\"I want to help the community in any way I can.\" \nEfforts like his may have helped keep Covid-19 at bay in Kakuma. \nThe most recent UNHCR figures, dating from 24 December, show that there had been 341 confirmed cases with 19 people under medical care. There have been 10 deaths from the virus.\nKenya has registered nearly 100,000 cases nationally, with around 1,700 deaths, health ministry figures show.\nPolitical instability and violence have forced more than 300,000 people to flee Burundi to neighbouring African countries in the last decade, according to the UNHCR.\nMr Havyarimana was in the middle of his chemistry studies at the University of Burundi when he left. He says his life was in danger and that he was receiving death threats from relatives of his late mother, who also seized his home.\nAfter arriving in Kakuma, he wanted to make money for himself, rather than relying on humanitarian aid.\nThe camp sits in an isolated and arid region where the provision of basic services is a challenge for relief agencies. \nExploring the region, Mr Havyarimana noticed there was not a soap factory, which meant that cleaning products had to be brought from elsewhere.\n\"I had no idea of how to make soap, so I started surfing the web for some knowledge,\" he explains.\nHe later enrolled in a soap-making course offered by the World Lutheran Federation aid agency, and with a loan from a former classmate in Burundi, he started the business alongside two helpers.\nHe also received grants from relief agencies including the UNHCR and NGOs such as the African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC), which says it has supported more then 18,000 refugee entrepreneurs.\n\"Innocent's story shows how refugees can contribute to their host communities in a number of ways,\" Julienne Oyler, the AEC's chair, tells the BBC.\n\"Camps like Kakuma are so isolated that entrepreneurs like him are a lifeline to basic goods and services at a time of lockdowns and other restrictions.\"\nA 2018 World Bank study identified over 2,000 businesses in Kakuma and estimated that they contributed more than $50m (\u00a337m) to the local economy every year.\nMichelle Richey, a lecturer in technology and entrepreneurship at the UK's Loughborough University specialising in refugee business ventures, says people like Mr Havyarimana are very import in changing the general perception of refugees.\n\"The human potential within refugees shows when we give them chances to work instead of just focusing on humanitarian issues,\" she says.\n\"We can help those people have some control of their lives again after all they have been through.\"\nStarting a thriving business is not the only change in Mr Havyarimana's life since arriving in Kakuma. In 2017, he married Aline, a fellow Burundian refugee he met at the camp. \nThey have two sons, and the youngest one, Prince, was born in late November. \nMr Havyarimana speaks with fondness about life in Kenya but he dreams of being resettled in Australia or Canada. \n\"I like Kakuma a lot, but I want to give my wife and kids a better life,\" he says.\nIn the meantime, Mr Havyarimana is focusing on expanding his ways to help the community, and as well as offering 21 kinds of soap and cleaning products, he has devised a hand sanitiser created from aloe vera grown in a patch just outside his workshop.\n\"Coronavirus has affected the whole world but for us here in Kakuma, it has made it even more important that we clean our hands in any we can,\" he says."},

Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony.\nThis is the second time Democrats have pursued impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nIn December 2019, the House impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020.\nNo US president has ever been impeached twice.\nHowever, the prospect of an impeachment conviction is unlikely because of Mr Trump's broad Republican support in the Senate.\nThe resolution drafted by three Democrats - who began writing it while under lockdown in the Capitol last Wednesday - consists of one article: \"Incitement of insurrection\".\n\"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,\" the resolution reads.\nIn the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in \"imminent lawless action at the Capitol\".\nThe resolution also says this was \"consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct\" the certification of President-elect Biden's election win.\n\"He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,\" the resolution says.\nImpeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial.\nArticles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial to decide whether to convict or not. There is no appeal against outcome.\nAn impeachment is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nMr Trump was the third US president to be impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were also left in office by the Senate.\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached in 1974, as political pressure built over the Watergate scandal.\nOn Monday, the Democrats presented a resolution to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president and the cabinet to declare Mr Trump unfit for office.\nThe resolution urged Mr Pence to \"declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the president is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office\".\nBut, as expected, the resolution was not adopted by unanimous consent in the House, after Republican Alex Mooney of West Virginia objected to the request.\nThe House has now gone into recess until Tuesday morning, when the chamber is expected to vote on the resolution.\nAfter the vote, the Democrats said they will give Mr Pence 24 hours to remove Mr Trump from office before they move toward impeachment.\n\"The president's threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,\" Speaker Pelosi said.\nAlthough Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment.\nImpeachments are usually long, drawn-out affairs, involving investigations and hearings that can take weeks to conclude. This impeachment is expected to be much quicker. \nMonday's presentation of the impeachment article to the House paves the way for a vote to be held. A simple majority in favour of impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Senate.\nHowever, an internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires.\nThe Senate is currently not in session, and all 100 senators would have to agree to change the schedule, which is highly unlikely.\nConstitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial when Mr Trump leaves office. But Democrats appear confident that the House can impeach Mr Trump and send the articles to the Senate for a trial at a later date.\nOn Sunday, Democratic House whip James Clyburn said the party may not send any articles to the Senate for trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office.\nIt's a new week in Washington DC, but the fallout from Wednesday's tragic events are just beginning.  \nWith only eight days left of Mr Trump's presidency, Democrats are very aware of the disruption an impeachment and a Senate trial would cause to the early days of Mr Biden's administration.\nThat's why there is talk of delaying Mr Trump's Senate trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office. \nAt that point, the pressure to remove Mr Trump will be past, but other punishments - stripping him of the accommodations and privileges ex-presidents enjoy and prohibiting him from future federal office - still apply.\nA year ago, Senate Republicans voted as a block to acquit the president of impeachment charges. This time, however, there may be some willing to side with Democrats to make sure that Trump, once out of power, never returns again."},

There were 112 positive cases at the 66 EFL clubs in its most recent round of testing. \nThe Football Association will be reminding everyone of their responsibilities.\nIt is understood there are no plans to halt elite sport but government ministers are concerned that the images from dressing rooms could make it harder to defend its continuation. \nA Whitehall source confirmed to the BBC that the celebrations at Chorley and Crawley Town had been noted by ministers, who last week warned football's authorities they had to do all they could to justify elite sport carrying on.\nIn his letter written to clubs on Monday, seen by BBC Sport, EFL chief executive Birch also said: \"Throughout the pandemic, football has provided a glimmer of hope for many millions of people affected by restrictions but we all understand the scrutiny the game remains under.\n\"While football is permitted to continue the actions of all participants will clearly be under the microscope. \n\"I am therefore personally asking you to re-double your efforts, to check, amend and tighten your protocol accordingly, and ensure that players and staff are left in no doubt as to their responsibilities on matchdays.\"\nProfessor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told BBC Breakfast that allowing team sports to continue was \"a balancing act\".\n\"The balancing act is trying to minimise the amount of contact outside very structured environments while trying to keep some semblance of life as will all know it,\" he said.  \n\"It is very much a matter for individuals in their day-to-day life. We have all got to say what, in our own lives, can we do to minimise the amount of impact we have on the NHS and the vulnerable?\"\nElite sport is not quite in the last-chance saloon, but the exemption it has been granted, at a time when grassroots sport has had to stop, cannot be taken for granted. \nA suspension is not yet imminent, but there are also no guarantees, especially if infection rates continue to rise, hospitals become overwhelmed, and the national lockdown has to be strengthened further. The government's patience seems to be wearing thin after the scenes of crowded dressing-room celebrations made a mockery of the social-distancing protocols that clubs were reminded of. \nThe optics of on-field hugs and handshakes, and fans gathering outside grounds, beamed into millions of homes at a time when the government is desperate for the public to stay at home and avoid contact with other households, is highly unhelpful to those making the case for professional sport to be allowed to continue. \nMy understanding is that ministers and medical experts' concerns do not amount to a final warning; they realise that the coverage of elite sport encourages people to stay at home and helps to retain some normality and balance in people's lives, and that protocols have largely been successful in suppressing transmission around training and fixtures. \nBut having warned sports bodies of their responsibilities last week, the government does now expect to see the football authorities in particular redouble their efforts, and for players' behaviour to reflect the privilege they enjoy in being able to continue to work when there has been so much disruption in so many people's work and lives. \nCertainly, football can ill afford any more high-profile breaches of the guidelines by players when away from their clubs.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the rules around celebrations in particular could be \"difficult to understand\".\n\"To control emotions when you are playing at 200mph is very difficult,\" he said on Monday.\n\"We are asking our players at corners, for example, to be man-marking people, pushing people around and not fist-bump anyone.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola voiced similar concerns, saying: \"When one guy scores a goal, I don't know if they can be controlled and not celebrate it.\n\"The joy to celebrate it, I don't know if [a player] is going to think: 'I cannot hug my mate for two, three seconds'.\"\nWolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo described the increase of cases as \"scary\".\n\"What I'm afraid of is the decision to stop - football as we know now will not be the same,\" he said.\n\"This is my biggest fear because the schedule will go crazy.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said: \"Everyone knows the situation and if it gets suspended I don't think it'd be a surprise.\n\"We'll just go with what the Government and Premier League have to say and, if it's the case to carry on, we'll carry on. But I don't think I'm being controversial if I say I don't think anyone would be surprised if we don't carry on with the way it's sweeping through the country.\"\nDespite fans not being allowed to attend matches, football still allows for some sense of escapism - a point Arteta emphasised.\n\"We know what we can bring to society if we are able to do it in safe way,\" he said.\n\"There are a lot of positives to take but it is just that balance. When we are still safe, we can add something positive without this difficult context.\""},

But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents.\nDuring the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of him stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\" \nFor this revolutionary the harvest is still not over.\nMy introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out. \nThe piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings.\nIt is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity.\nHe is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure.\nMany young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language).\nBut the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around. \nIn his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the last election, he has been traversing the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets.\nAnd with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni has been keen to show his vitality. Last April, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November. \n\"If your father loves you, he has to empower you. In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern.\nThe economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power.\nOne of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty. \n\"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says.\n\"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent\u2026 he is an Africanist.\"\nNevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005.\nIndeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm.\nJournalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life.\n\"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote.\nBut something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits. \nHe had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age. \nAnd then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building. \nMany saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life.\nIt is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president. \nThe significance of patronage extends right through society.\nIt sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution.\nBut his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years.\n\"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council.\nWhile acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\".\nDespite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority.\nThe judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government. \nWhen judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.\nFor example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. \n\"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple.\nWhen it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment.\nThe media has also had its independence threatened.\nOn the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni. \n\"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala.\nBut outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds.\nBut perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered.\nAs it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents.\nKizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, once Mr Museveni's physician, first ran against him in the 2001 election. He has been detained and prosecuted on numerous charges, including rape and treason, but has never been convicted.\nNow that Bobi Wine, a singer whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is mounting a serious challenge to the president's rule, he has become the latest politician to face the wrath of the men in uniform.\nThe MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped. \nOn the campaign trail for this election, the police have arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups.\nDuring two days of protests in November following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces.\nSticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face.\nThrough his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control. He has also managed to reinvent himself. \nWhereas he was once the political upstart in his early 40s, anyone taking on that role now risks incurring his considerable wrath."},

{"title": "How Mexico is reclaiming spirulina", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20210111-how-mexico-is-reclaiming-spirulina", "tag": "travel", "tag2": "story", "author": "Nicholas DeRenzo", "article_text": "\nIf you've spent any time dining in Mexico City recently, you may have noticed spirulina cropping up on menus in everything from the usual smoothies to more traditional dishes such as tortillas and \ntlayudas\n (a crisp tortilla base with refried beans and other toppings). But don't assume this is some symbol of encroaching hipster health food globalisation: in fact, centuries before it was deemed a \"superfood\", the vibrantly coloured cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae) \u2013 which grows primarily in warm alkaline lakes, ponds and rivers in the tropics and subtropics \u2013 was a pre-Hispanic dietary staple.\nThe Mexica \u2013 or Aztecs, as they were later known \u2013 harvested the protein-rich substance from the surface of Lake Texcoco, an expansive body of water in central Mexico that was later largely drained by the Spanish to make way for the construction of Mexico City. Here, the waters exhibited the perfect balance of salinity and alkalinity for spirulina to flourish. The Mexica called the foodstuff \ntecuitlatl\n, a Nahuatl word that roughly translates to \"rock excrement\", though they held it in decidedly higher esteem than its name suggests.\n\"Oral traditions say that the Mexica couriers and runners in ancient Tenochtitlan would eat dried spirulina cakes with corn, tortillas, beans, chillies or mole as fuel for long-distance travel,\" said Denise Vallejo, an indigenous first-generation Xicana chef who runs the vegan Los Angeles pop-up \nAlchemy Organica\n.\nEven without modern science, the Mexica could recognise the nutrient density that has made spirulina such a favourite today. It boasts about 60-70% protein by weight and has essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals, especially iron, manganese and B vitamins, according to the Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements. It's so healthy and relatively easy to grow, in fact, that \nexperts think it could be a potential food source for future Mars colonies\n.\nOf course, to the arriving Spanish conquistadors in the 16th Century, it mostly just looked odd. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo wrote in his 1568 memoir about \"a species of bread made of a kind of mud or slime collected from the surface of the lake, and eaten in that form, and has a similar taste to our cheese.\" And Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan included illustrations of spirulina harvesting in his 16th-Century ethnographic study, the Florentine Codex.\n\"After the Spanish invasion, most of its consumption declined with the draining of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico,\" Vallejo said. \"And many of the Spanish didn't enjoy its 'cheesy' or 'slimy' properties. Knowledge of its consumption was lost for a long time.\"\nThe Western world rediscovered the nutritious ingredient in the 1940s, when a French phycologist (a scientist who studies algae) noticed the Kanembu people along Africa's Lake Chad harvesting spirulina and turning it into sun-dried cakes called \ndih\u00e9\n. But it didn't make its grand return to Mexico until a happy accident in the 1960s, when the owners of Sosa Texcoco \u2013 which produced sodium carbonate and calcium chloride in a large snail-shaped pond on the remnants of Lake Texcoco \u2013 noticed a green substance mucking up the works. They reached out to French researchers, who concluded that it was the same organism that had been nourishing the Kanembu for generations. Rather than try to eradicate the cyanobacteria, Sosa Texcoco recognized its value, encouraged its growth and opened the world's first commercial spirulina company, Spirulina Mexicana.\nWhile Spirulina Mexicana has since closed, a micro-farm on the outskirts of San Miguel de Allende called \nSpirulina Viva\n is continuing the ancient tradition. Since 2010, American expat Katie Kohlstedt and her San Luis Potos\u00ed-born husband, Francisco Portillo, have grown fresh spirulina that probably tastes remarkably similar to what the Mexica harvested centuries ago. \"We're really proud to grow it here,\" she said. \"We didn't have to invent something new or bring something from somewhere else.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\n\u2022 \nMexico's ancient caviar\n\u2022 \nWhere there's no queso in quesadilla\n\u2022 \nMexico City's walking fish\nWhile many people may be familiar with spirulina in its dehydrated powdered form, Spirulina Viva sells the green stuff raw and frozen, which imparts a much more delicate flavour. \"Fresh spirulina should be creamy like a spreadable cheese,\" Kohlstedt said. \"If you closed your eyes, you might think you were eating a cross between an avocado and spinach.\" She noted that if you think of spirulina as fishy or an acquired taste, chances are you've been buying a lesser-quality product \u2013 or even one that uses ground fish bones to provide the phosphorus the spirulina needs to grow.\nKohlstedt and Portillo lead spirulina-growing workshops and have welcomed future farmers from as far away as Australia and Argentina. \"It's gardening combined with chemistry,\" Kohlstedt said of the process. But for many consumers, the finished product still remains a bit of a mystery. \"If I read one more article that said spirulina is grown in the ocean or [that shows] a picture of seaweed, I'm just going to scream,\" she said, with a laugh. \"My other two least favourite words are 'pond scum'. I think that's really offensive actually!\"\nKohlstedt recommends eating spirulina as simply as possible, stirred into warm miso soup or bone broth, blended into a smoothie, spread on bread or mixed into guacamole with extra lime juice, because vitamin C has been shown to help iron absorption. \"You're going to feel like you just ate Popeye's lunch,\" she said.\nIn Mexico City, chefs are getting even more creative with the ingredient. You might find spirulina dusting a tlayuda topped with avocado and \nescamoles \n(ant larvae) at \nBalc\u00f3n del Z\u00f3calo\n; brightening a superfood tortilla at \nCintli Tortilleria\n; adding a verdant punch to the smoothie bowls and cheesecakes at \nVegamo\n; and even spiking cocktails at the pre-Hispanic-inspired \nXam\na\nn Bar\n.\nThere, head bartender Kenneth Rodrigez has incorporated spirulina into a number of drinks, including a gin-based cocktail with Mexican lime and asparagus liqueur. \"I use it when somebody doesn't like egg whites or [in drinks for] vegan people, because spirulina has protein and we can get interesting textures,\" Rodrigez said, \"not to mention the incredible colour and the nutritional components that it provides.\"\u00a0\nHe describes the taste notes as \"green, herbal and \nclorofila \n(chlorophyll),\" and said that \"it can be used to enhance other flavours, because it has lots of minerals, like an alternative for salt.\"\u00a0\nAcross the border in Mexican American communities, using spirulina has meant establishing a direct connection with a pre-Hispanic past. At San Antonio's inventive Mexican restaurant \nMixtli\n, for instance, chefs Rico Torres and Diego Galicia featured spirulina on a special menu inspired by the Spanish conquest, and they participated in a collaborative D\u00eda de los Muertos dinner at New York's \nJames\nBeard House\n, where one of the hors d'oeuvres was a smoked spirulina yogurt with trout roe and radishes.\nAt Alchemy Organica, Vallejo incorporates spirulina powder into a pineapple \nagua fresca\n (a Mexican drink made with water, sugar and pureed fruits, seeds, flowers or grains for flavour) with lime and chia seeds. And she has even used it as \"a natural food colouring and nutritional boost, along with cactus and spinach powders\" to make vibrant green \nmasa\n (dough made with corn that has been nixtamalized, or treated with an alkaline solution), which she turns into colourful tortillas and tamales. \"I also use it as a flavour enhancer for some of my seafood-inspired dishes, as it imparts a flavour much like seaweed,\" she explained.\u00a0\nAnd when one of her cooks began selling fresh spirulina at a farmer's market, Vallejo took to simply scooping spoonfuls into her drinks. \"It gives you energy like you'd expect from a cup of coffee!\" she said.\nIn a sense, these chefs are tapping into something much deeper than simply taste or nutrition. Vallejo, who studies \ncuranderismo \n(folk medicine), said that spirulina is often viewed as a detoxifier to prepare for rituals, spells and \"visionary plant ceremonies\". And Kohlstedt has similarly heard about the ingredient's mystical connections, which draw on the similarities between spirulina's helical shape and our own building blocks as humans: \"Someone told me that the reason it's called 'spirulina' has to do with its spiral form, but that it also has to do with our DNA and how there is something really basic and spiritual about how we relate to plants [and cyanobacteria].\"\n\"So many of the 'superfoods' enjoyed today have a rich history in Mesoamerica: chia, amaranth, cacao, avocado, cactus,\" Vallejo noted. \"I think the current decolonising movement in Xicanx, Central American and other Spanish-speaking communities is helping us to rediscover and remember our ancestral foodways. We get to take back our foods and our plant wisdom.

It premiered on HBO in 1998 and ran for six seasons until 2004.\nThe show inspired two films, Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010.

Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it.\nBluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features.\nRaising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well.\nWi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in. \nConnecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers.\nUsing a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale.\nWorldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, \n.\nSmartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia.\nTaiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step.\nBut some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough.\nAs principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks.\nHe says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems. \n\"I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely.\"\nThere is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability. \n\"Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,\" he says.\nAnother challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi. \n\"Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,\" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks.\n\"The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,\" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly. \nOne solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection.\nIt can also be tricky to install smart locks.\nYale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws. \nHelpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky.\n\"I'm a bit of a door nerd now,\" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks.\nFor fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy. \nOne workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether. \nA server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. \"The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,\" she says. \nLock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens. \nSome want an \"active command and control experience\" using Siri or Alexa. \nBut others long for locks to \"do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,\" he says.\nIf we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in.\nThey can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.\nIf you, or someone you know, are affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) "},

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Atlanta and Feud: Bette and Joan. \nThe Sex Pistols electrified British music and, depending on who you believed, threatened the very fabric of society at the tail end of the 1970s. \nThey may only have survived for two years, but their angry, nihilistic singles and violent performances changed the idea of what rock and roll could be. \nOriginally formed in 1972 by Jones and drummer Paul Cook, they were galvanized by the addition of John Lydon - aka Johnny Rotten - whose abrasive vocals and anti-establishment lyrics defined the band and, to a large extent, the British punk movement.\nThey only released one album, but the sheer sonic force of songs like Anarchy In The UK, God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant became symbols of Britain's social and political turmoil, as youth unemployment soared, with young people particularly affected.\nNot that everyone was impressed by the Sex Pistols' curious combination of anger and apathy. \nTheir singles were blacklisted on the British charts and a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying their album cover. Facing bans across the UK, the group had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. - \"Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly\".\nAlways on the verge of chaos, they finally split up on a US tour in 1978. \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" a tired and disillusioned Johnny Rotten asked the audience at their final show - but their legacy was ensured.\n\"Imagine breaking into the world of The Crown and Downton Abbey with your mates and screaming your songs and your fury at all they represent,\" said Boyle, announcing his new project. \n\"This is the moment that British society and culture changed forever. It is the detonation point for British street culture... where ordinary young people had the stage and vented their fury and their fashion\u2026and everyone had to watch and listen\".\nThe series is based on Steve Jones's memoir, Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol; which doesn't just focus on his time with the band.\nIt begins in West London, where the young musician suffered maternal neglect and sexual abuse by a step-father, and quickly fell into crime - including an attempt to climb the chimneys of Battersea Power Station, and stealing amps from a David Bowie gig.\nAfter becoming entranced by the glam rock scene, he is taken under the wings of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who helped form, style and promote the Sex Pistols.\nThe book demystifies the band behind the myth - showing how they struggled with the criticisms lobbed their way and the pressure of living up to their image, including the moment Jones was goaded into swearing live on primetime TV.\nLater chapters deal with his battles with addiction, and his recent reinvention as a tee-total \"semi-retired sexual deviant who doesn't really act out so much any more\".\nBritish-born, Australian-raised actor Toby Wallace will play Jones, following eye-catching roles in the coming-of-age drama Babyteeth and Netflix drama The Society, where he played evil teen Campbell Elliot.\nAnson Boon, last seen in the Kate Winslet tear-jerker Blackbird takes on the spittle-flecked role of Johnny Rotten; while out-of-control bassist Sid Vicious will be played by Louis Partridge.\nSydney Chandler - daughter of film star Kyle - will become Pretenders star Chrissie Hynde, who had an affair with Jones at the height of the Sex Pistols' fame.\nThe Witcher's Emma Appleton is cast as Nancy Spungen, the American girlfriend of Sid Vicious, who died in mysterious circumstances in October 1978.\nAnd Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams plays \"the face of punk\", the iconoclastic model and actress Pamela Rooke, whose signature style - ripped fishnets, dominatrix heels and raccoon-like eye make-up - defined the scene.\nThe Sex Pistols project isn't the only musical series in the pipeline.

The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals.\nPCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment.\nA series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity.\nThe chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea.\nPCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises.\nOne killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded.\nAlthough levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely.\nPCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life. \nA recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a \"cocktail of pollutants\", which are passed down from mother to calf.\nScientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain.\nIn humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality.\nStrandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast.\nThe deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections.\nIn the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades.\nThe study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility.\n\"Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,\" said Rosie Williams.\nPopulations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility.\n\"This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,\" she said.\n\"That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals.\"\nThere are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber.\nThe study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.\nFollow Helen on \n."},

I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual.\nBut then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read. \nWith a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now.\nParler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too.\nTechnology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons.\n\"Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,\" she said.\nIt's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too.\nAgain, this is not unheard of. \nGab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days.\nWhat is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president.\nSince Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch.\nYouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance.\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as \"problematic\".\nEU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as \"the 9/11 moment of social media\", \n that \"the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing\".\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now \"taking editorial decisions\", adding that platforms were \"choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice\".\nElsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship.\nHe tweeted: \"The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship.\"\nThe fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter.\nOne of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse.\nPlatforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies.\nBut since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders.\nIn March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation.\nIt wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence.\nThe president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\".\nSocial media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets \"a pivotal precedent\" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post.\nSome analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide.\nOn Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election.\nPrivacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants. \n\"Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world. I think the president's removal might be the beginning of a purge for similar behaviour globally.\"\nIn his final hours on Twitter, Mr Trump once again blamed a piece of US legislation called Section 230 for \"banning\" free speech. During his presidency he threatened to repeal the law which makes social networks largely exempt from liability for their users' post.\nMany argue that removing the protection would actually harm free speech as networks would be forced to moderate far more than they currently do.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden has also stated that he would like to repeal the law to increase moderation and reduce the spread of fake news.\nIn the same final tweet Mr Trump said that he has been negotiating with \"various other sites\" and that there would be \"a big announcement soon\".\nIf the events of recent days are anything to go by, Mr Trump and some of his supporters face an uphill struggle against not just lawmakers but tech giants too before they can establish themselves on mainstream social media."},
{"title": "Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55575756", "tag": "news", "tag2": "world-europe", "author": "N/A", "article_text": "\nMember states decide individually who to vaccinate, when and where, but the EU is coordinating strategy and buying vaccines in bulk. On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021.\nBBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch.\nThe fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation.\nA recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground.\nVaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than\nfirst doses had been administered. \nBut some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses.\nMuch of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order.\nGermany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. \nMr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand.\nGermany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer.\nThe Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager.\nBut the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. \"We believed when we contributed \u20ac12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,\" he told a newspaper this week.\nThe country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to \n people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. \nIt has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature.\nHowever, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer.\nFrance's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to \n - still so small as to be statistically meaningless.  \nSo why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used.\nThe primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. \nEach recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives.\nAnother problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers.\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings.\nPolitically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a \"state scandal\", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free.\nRussia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity.\nSputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded.\nA poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week that \n had been vaccinated.\nBut one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown.\nRussia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped.\nAlmost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is still \nof how many others have received the vaccination. \nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains \"feasible\". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. \nAlongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February.\nSwedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine.\nA successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. \nMeanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands.\nIt seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further \nelderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial.\nThe mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be \"seamless and fast\", tweeting: \"If that does not work, shoot me.\"\nThe first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September.\nYou may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed.\nAfter getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its \"careful\" approach.\nAnd there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. \nIn a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least.\nSpain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with \npeople vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. \nEach of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. \nGovernment data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. \nAlthough vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination.\nHowever, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. \nThe arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by \"political affiliations or parliamentary needs\", a claim the central government has rejected.

But it says the design has \"great potential\".\nOne day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet.\nIn traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky.\nUnder a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload.\nMaveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\"There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,\" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant.\n\"We believe that we have to go into a really\u2026 breakthrough technology,\" she says.\nAn equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.\nResearchers there are working on a design known as the \"Flying-V\". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350.\nLike Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves.\nThe designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be \"plugged\" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once.\n\"We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,\" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology.\nThe design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany.\nThe flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success.\nResearchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as \"Dutch roll\". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as \"a somewhat rough landing\" that damaged the front landing gear.\nData from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator.\nAirlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V.\nThe attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact.\nBut with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as \"showstoppers\".\nAmong them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency.\nThere's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the \"wing\" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal.\nBuilding a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region.\n\"That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,\" says Mr Wright.\nAirbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer.\nIts rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing.\nAircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier.\nBoeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design.\nBut current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at \n - are based on proving that concept.\nFor longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power.\nOne major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane.\nBut the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities.\nThose priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion.\nAirbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power.\nIn September, Airbus \n.\nHydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing.\nBut there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide.\nIn order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution.\n\"Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,\" he explains."},

For nearly five years, she willingly paid the city's premium rents and taxes, while commuting to work in another state.\nBut the pandemic wore her down.\n\"I was like, 'The city's going to come back. By July, it's going to be ok.' But it just kept not being ok,\" she says.\n\"I wasn't planning on leaving at all,\" she adds. \"It was a complete switch.\"\nSince March, property firms and moving companies have reported a rush of demand from people leaving New York, many of them young families, as the pandemic drives demand for bigger homes and more outdoor space, while making relocation easier by expanding remote work.\nAnd so far, the surge hasn't shown signs of slowing, says Liz Nunan, president of property firm Houlihan Lawrence, which handles home sales in suburbs around New York City, and reported its best year on record in 2020.\n\"One of the things I learned in 2020 is that I have no idea what the future holds, but I feel rather bullish on 2021,\" she says. \"I believe we'll have a year that's nearly as strong as 2020 turned out to be.\"\nLast year, longer distance relocations from New York City helped push New York the state to the biggest population decline of any in the US, putting it on track for its first population fall of any decade since the 1970s. \nThe signs of outflow have spawned a small universe of articles debating whether New York City is dead or dying, and what - if anything - should be done to help it recover. \nAnd as the US confronts an economic crisis likely to outlast the pandemic that precipitated it, such concerns are not unique to the US's largest city.\nSmaller downtowns across the country have watched in despair as signs of long-sought revival - new restaurants, businesses in formerly abandoned buildings - disappear almost overnight.\n\"This is a difficult time for everybody,\" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank. \"The real issue is: can these cities hold their economic vitality?\" \nIn New York, the pandemic has closed theatres, emptied offices, halted tourism, and turned shopping and dining into hazards to be undertaken at your own risk, gutting industries that employed a fifth of the city's workforce.\nAs many as a third of the city's small businesses may not survive the pandemic, according to estimates by local business group, the Partnership for New York City. Most companies in the city's downtown do not expect staff to ever return to the office in full force. Some firms have already left.\nThe situation has \n - almost double the national average - swollen the ranks of the homeless, and helped spur the departure of more than 300,000 people like Andrea, further straining public finances.\nIn response, New York leaders have raised the prospect of increasing taxes and cutting services like transportation, garbage collection and park maintenance, while begging for emergency aid from Washington to resolve financial woes - pleas that so far have fallen on deaf ears.\nMichael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at the free market Manhattan Institute think tank, worries the potential cuts will further accelerate the outflow, hurting the very amenities that make city life attractive and leaving a poorer city for those who remain.\n\"It's not really so much the pandemic that is the greatest challenge to New York City,\" he says. \"It's really the second order consequences that have dealt a blow to the city's recovery and its citizens.\n\"New York is not dead, but it is on life support,\" he says. \"Whether its recovery is measured in months or years or decades is primarily determined by the degree of leadership that we see in the city. And I think that's why we should be so concerned.\"\nIn some ways, such worries are uniquely American, reflecting the safety woes and weak educational systems that set so many US cities apart from counterparts in Europe and Canada, says Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto. He predicts that coronavirus outflow from cities outside the US will be less dramatic and more temporary.\nIn the US, however, the urban revival of the early 2000s had shown signs of fading even before the pandemic, as immigration waned and moves to the suburbs accelerated. \nIn New York, the population has been falling since 2016.\nThe expansion of remote work caused by the pandemic means the city is now competing with even more places for businesses and families - trends that are unlikely to fully reverse even after life returns to normal, Prof Florida says.\n\"Talented people have choice now with remote work. Those choices will be made carefully,\" he says. \"The big winners are places with a lot of amenity, and the premium for amenity will grow. That means cities with wonderful coast lines or rural areas near mountains. Places like Miami Beach, or Bozeman, Montana, or Aspen, Colorado, or the Hudson Valley of New York.\" \nAndrea, who initially decamped to her mother's home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says she hasn't entirely written off New York. But for now, she's planning a cross-country road trip, working remotely while scoping out new cities to potentially call home.  \n\"I'm going to hop in the car\u2026 and drive around the country, and see if anything feels like a fit,\" she says. \"If it doesn't, then I'll see where the world is in September.\"\nKevin Pearsall and his wife left New York City in March for Atlanta, Georgia. After years of focusing on their careers in advertising, the 35-year-old says they wanted a hometown where they didn't feel like housing and other living costs remained a stretch - even on their healthy six-figure salaries.\nThey both landed jobs as remote workers for New York firms - another sign that convinced them the city was no longer the only place they could combine professional opportunity and social life.\n\"All of the great things about New York - speakeasies, beer gardens... that's not really as unique as it used to be,\" he says.\n\"We were already in motion, thinking about leaving,\" he says. The pandemic \"just accelerated\" the move.\nNew York leaders have expressed confidence that the city will remain a draw, noting that outflow of a few hundred thousand hardly makes a dent in a city of more than eight million. \n\"I'm not going to beg people to stay,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last year. \"I know this city will rebound. I know it. And I know others will come. They have for generations.\" \n\"We can't overrate this moment in history,\" he added. \"It is a passing moment. There will be a vaccine. And then all the strengths of New York City will reassert again.\"\nHow it will shake out in the long term remains a question.\nThe neighbourhoods that emptied during lockdowns last year were the city's wealthiest, but a Manhattan Institute survey this summer found that \n with dissatisfaction highest among those with lower incomes.\nMr Hendrix says it is tempting to hope a more affordable city will emerge if the rich depart, but he worries such an exodus will generate still more challenges, given how dependent the city is on high earners for tax revenue.\n\"It doesn't take a majority leaving the city or a majority changing their lifestyle to make a big difference,\" he says.\n is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nProf Florida says the biggest cities, like New York and San Francisco, are likely to remain a draw for young people, who should benefit if rents continue to fall. \nBut he warns that such declines were short-lived after previous crises. And elsewhere in America, he expects downtown business districts - \n - to face major challenges.\n\"The central business districts - those places which packed and stacked knowledge workers in the vertical towers - they are in for a real reckoning,\" he says.

Mr Wolf last week called on Mr Trump to \"strongly condemn\" the protesters who stormed Congress.\nThe outgoing secretary said his departure had been prompted by \"recent events\", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment.\nLaw enforcement around the country are said to be bracing for the possibility of further violence in the days before Joe Biden takes office. \nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.   \n around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. \nCalls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots.\nLocal police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses following last week's violence, according to US media. \nThe Reuters news agency, citing a federal law enforcement official, said the FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. \nAlthough the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were reported elsewhere in the country at the same time.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday that it would begin National Special Security Event (NSSE) operations for the inauguration six days early, starting Wednesday.\nThe designation allows a wide range of security and law enforcement agencies to coordinate together on special protective measures, like enforcing road closures and a secure perimeter.\nThe announcement came after Washington DC's Mayor, Ms Bowser, went public with her appeal to bolster security after what she described as an \"unprecedented terrorist attack\" at the US Capitol last week.\nShe has also asked Americans to avoid travel to Washington DC for the event. Inaugurations traditionally draw hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital, but the coronavirus pandemic had already curtailed those plans before security fears were heightened. \nThe Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, said Monday that 10,000 troops will be in Washington DC by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested by local officials.\nElsewhere, the National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid \"credible threats\" of further violence.  \n\"Groups involved in the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol continue to threaten to disrupt the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20,\" the service said in a statement, adding it could institute further temporary closures to other areas within the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \nSpeaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was \"not afraid\" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears.\nHis inauguration committee has announced that the ceremony will be themed around \"America United\". \nAfter being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. \nDonald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years not to do so.\nThe warnings about further pro-Trump violence come as efforts move forward to impeach the president for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol.\nAn article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" during a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was \"stolen\" from him. \nDemocrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office.\nMr Trump has made no public statements since \n - on Friday.\nIt comes as websites and social media networks crackdown against other users and websites seen to be encouraging violence - including social network Parler, \n.

He helped limit the spread of HIV, and more recently his harsh lockdown - which closed schools and business, banned vehicle movement and imposed mandatory public mask use in May - is credited with tackling the coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to Johns Hopkins University, \n and around just 300 deaths from the illness.\nBut while he was once hailed in the West as one of the new generation of African leaders, his critics accuse him of turning into another authoritarian leader. \nMr Museveni has no designated successor within his party, and in 2017 \n allowing him to run again for the presidency. \nHe has seen off a number of challengers to his rule over the years, notably long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was arrested numerous times and decided not to run again for the presidency in 2021. \nWhile Mr Museveni maintains a large support base, especially in rural areas, he is facing increasing opposition over rising inequality and his rigid control over the country.\nOne of 10 candidates challenging him for the presidency this year is musician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known by the stage name Bobi Wine. \nAffectionately referred to as the \"ghetto president\", the 38-year-old became an East African musical superstar in the early 2000s before switching to politics and winning a seat in parliament in 2017.\nBobi Wine is seen as the biggest challenge to Mr Museveni's rule and has mobilised many young people who have not previously been involved in politics. He has sharply criticised the president in the past and accused him of \"fearing the people\".\nThe president has not taken this challenge lightly. He has accused Bobi Wine of being a foreign agent of those \"who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda\" and said that opposition figures are misleading young people to get involved in violence on the campaign trail. \nBobi Wine has been arrested several times since he became involved in politics. He has spoken of a \"revolution\" against Mr Museveni. \n using the hashtag \"WeAreRemovingADictator\".\nPart of Bobi Wine's popularity comes down to his age. At 38, he is just half as old as President Museveni, in one of the youngest nations on earth. \n Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide, of just 15.7 - only Niger is younger. \nThe \"ghetto president\" grew up in a slum in the capital, Kampala. His background and his efforts to promote social justice in his country through his music and as a politician have endeared him to this younger, more urban generation. \nBut Bobi Wine has also surprised authorities by drawing big crowds of supporters in rural areas - thought to be a bastion of support for President Museveni.\nTensions are high, and the campaign has been marred by serious violence, which has left dozens killed and hundreds more arrested. \nOfficials have cited measures brought in to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic for their efforts to break up political gatherings. But \n that security forces are using these regulations \"as a pretext to violate rights and clamp down on the opposition and the media\". \n for allegedly breaching Covid measures. His detention sparked protest which led to a wave of arrests and left dozens dead, mostly allegedly shot by the security forces.\nAfterwards, \n and said \"police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence\".\n\"Can I repeat? Police have a right to shoot you and you die for nothing.... do it at your own risk.\"\nBobi Wine has since taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest and helmet on the campaign trail. \nAt the end of last year he halted his campaign after a number of his team were injured as security forces dispersed one of his political rallies. He later told broadcaster CNN he had survived several assassination attempts. \nA country of more than 42 million people, Uganda is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nIt has one of the highest refugee populations worldwide, hosting \n from neighbouring countries. \nSome are watching the political unrest in the country with concern, and worry about what could happen after the vote. There has never been a peaceful transfer of power in Uganda and it is not clear what would happen if Mr Museveni were to lose, and what the military would do.\nThe president announced a shake-up of the armed forces in November, bringing in the former head of Uganda's operations in Somalia, Maj Gen Paul Lokech, as deputy inspector general of police to coordinate security forces around the capital during the election period. \nThe European Union has chosen not to send observers to the election this year - reportedly because \n to make polling more fair - meaning there will be less international scrutiny.

The opposition says this is because it is popular in those areas, but the government says the measure is due to Covid-19 restrictions. \n\"We found this network to be linked to the government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda,\" Facebook said in a statement. \n\"They used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were,\" the statement continued. \nBut government spokesman Ofwono Opondo hit back in a \n, accusing Facebook of failing to adhere to \"natural justice\" and echoing suggestions by other government figures that the social network is trying to influence the election outcome. \n\"We are not familiar with anybody who complains about these accounts,\" he said. \"The owners have not received any notice and no-one was asked to make any response to the allegations.\"\nMr Opondo described Facebook as high-handed. \"I think they are playing the usual games,\" he added. \"We know that they have a side in this election perhaps.\" \nThe government spokesman said Thursday's elections would be free and fair.\nThe BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that the campaign period has been dominated by social media, as political parties moved to reach a young, politically aware population.\nMany new accounts promoting messages from both the ruling party and the opposition have popped up in the last couple of months, especially on Facebook and Twitter. In many cases, the users did not use proper names, and shared content filled with hate messages and fake news, she says. \nUgandans online have said saying that the government has finally got a taste of what it feels like to be censured.\nIn December, the Uganda Communications Commission, the media industry regulator, wrote to Google, asking it to shut down several YouTube channels associated with Bobi Wine.\nIn the past, the government body has ordered online content creators such as influencers and bloggers to register and have their material vetted before publication, but this was put on hold after it was challenged in court. \nDuring the 2016 election, the government blocked social media on polling day and for several after, which led to the proliferation of VPN use in the country.\nIt feels like there is a fresh wind blowing through social media in terms of how it deals with political content.\nFirst we saw US President Donald Trump banned from Twitter and Facebook and now that has been extended beyond the US to Africa. \nFacebook has shut a slew of accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials, accusing them of \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\" in the public debate ahead of Thursday's election.\nMark Zuckerberg has long insisted that the platform he founded has to allow all forms of free speech and cannot become an arbiter of political conversations.\nSo what has changed? The truth is that the platform has increasingly focused on misinformation in recent years but the violence and chaos witnessed at the heart of the US government in recent days have forced it to speed up these attempts, and make some pretty big decisions.\nThe days of describing itself as a mere conduit for content seem to be well and truly over.\nIt has tried lots of ways to reduce misinformation, including ranking reliable journalism higher than fake news and training algorithms to identify \"bad\" posts, but it has had mixed results.\nBut now with all eyes on it, it is going to have to find a way to deal with content in a way that pleases politicians, its users and its advertisers, who do not want to be associated with a platform that is being accused of inciting unrest or influencing the results of elections.\nIt remains unclear how it will do so in the long term but in the short term expect more knee-jerk reactions to political events around the world.\nAnd the new look for the social network will come at a price.\nSome Ugandan officials are already accusing it of meddling in its election. Facebook could be stuck between a rock and a hard place for some time to come."},

So I lowered the prices, as it was more important to protect people than to think of profit,\" the 35-year-old tells the BBC.\n\"I had to increase my production by 75% to meet the demand when the pandemic started, so Covid-19 has been good for my business.\n\"But I made sure I gave free soap to vulnerable people such as the elderly and the disabled.\"\nMr Havyarimana's initiative has been praised by the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, which often highlights the contribution of refugee entrepreneurs to their host communities.\n\"The refugees are playing a pivotal role in helping contain the spread of Covid-19 in Kakuma,\" Eujin Byun, a spokesperson for UNHCR in Kenya tells the BBC.\n\"They helped in many ways, from disseminating information about the virus to helping people take the necessary measures.\"\nShe added that she was not surprised by Mr Havyarimana's decision to lower prices.\n\"Refugees are very community-oriented and they will look after each other. They have previously stepped up and helped us do our jobs in situations like that.\"\nMr Havyarimana currently employs 42 people in his business, named Glap Industries - short for God Loves All People. The bulk of the workers are refugees but 18 are Kenyans from the town of Kakuma.\nGlap supplies local businesses and institutions outside the camp and even relief agencies.\n\"The agencies buy my soaps to give away to refugees who cannot afford them and for their own staff too,\" the Burundian proudly notes. \nMr Havyarimana is not the only local soap merchant, but he does not fear the competition, and in fact offers classes to teach people how to make cleaning products.\n\"I want to mentor women and younger people so they can have an opportunity to become self-reliant and improve their lives like I did,\" he says.\n\"I want to help the community in any way I can.\" \nEfforts like his may have helped keep Covid-19 at bay in Kakuma. \nThe most recent UNHCR figures, dating from 24 December, show that there had been 341 confirmed cases with 19 people under medical care. There have been 10 deaths from the virus.\nKenya has registered nearly 100,000 cases nationally, with around 1,700 deaths, health ministry figures show.\nPolitical instability and violence have forced more than 300,000 people to flee Burundi to neighbouring African countries in the last decade, according to the UNHCR.\nMr Havyarimana was in the middle of his chemistry studies at the University of Burundi when he left. He says his life was in danger and that he was receiving death threats from relatives of his late mother, who also seized his home.\nAfter arriving in Kakuma, he wanted to make money for himself, rather than relying on humanitarian aid.\nThe camp sits in an isolated and arid region where the provision of basic services is a challenge for relief agencies. \nExploring the region, Mr Havyarimana noticed there was not a soap factory, which meant that cleaning products had to be brought from elsewhere.\n\"I had no idea of how to make soap, so I started surfing the web for some knowledge,\" he explains.\nHe later enrolled in a soap-making course offered by the World Lutheran Federation aid agency, and with a loan from a former classmate in Burundi, he started the business alongside two helpers.\nHe also received grants from relief agencies including the UNHCR and NGOs such as the African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC), which says it has supported more then 18,000 refugee entrepreneurs.\n\"Innocent's story shows how refugees can contribute to their host communities in a number of ways,\" Julienne Oyler, the AEC's chair, tells the BBC.\n\"Camps like Kakuma are so isolated that entrepreneurs like him are a lifeline to basic goods and services at a time of lockdowns and other restrictions.\"\nA 2018 World Bank study identified over 2,000 businesses in Kakuma and estimated that they contributed more than $50m (\u00a337m) to the local economy every year.\nMichelle Richey, a lecturer in technology and entrepreneurship at the UK's Loughborough University specialising in refugee business ventures, says people like Mr Havyarimana are very import in changing the general perception of refugees.\n\"The human potential within refugees shows when we give them chances to work instead of just focusing on humanitarian issues,\" she says.\n\"We can help those people have some control of their lives again after all they have been through.\"\nStarting a thriving business is not the only change in Mr Havyarimana's life since arriving in Kakuma. In 2017, he married Aline, a fellow Burundian refugee he met at the camp. \nThey have two sons, and the youngest one, Prince, was born in late November. \nMr Havyarimana speaks with fondness about life in Kenya but he dreams of being resettled in Australia or Canada. \n\"I like Kakuma a lot, but I want to give my wife and kids a better life,\" he says.\nIn the meantime, Mr Havyarimana is focusing on expanding his ways to help the community, and as well as offering 21 kinds of soap and cleaning products, he has devised a hand sanitiser created from aloe vera grown in a patch just outside his workshop.\n\"Coronavirus has affected the whole world but for us here in Kakuma, it has made it even more important that we clean our hands in any we can,\" he says."},

Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony.\nThis is the second time Democrats have pursued impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nIn December 2019, the House impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020.\nNo US president has ever been impeached twice.\nHowever, the prospect of an impeachment conviction is unlikely because of Mr Trump's broad Republican support in the Senate.\nThe resolution drafted by three Democrats - who began writing it while under lockdown in the Capitol last Wednesday - consists of one article: \"Incitement of insurrection\".\n\"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,\" the resolution reads.\nIn the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in \"imminent lawless action at the Capitol\".\nThe resolution also says this was \"consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct\" the certification of President-elect Biden's election win.\n\"He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,\" the resolution says.\nImpeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial.\nArticles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial to decide whether to convict or not. There is no appeal against outcome.\nAn impeachment is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nMr Trump was the third US president to be impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were also left in office by the Senate.\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached in 1974, as political pressure built over the Watergate scandal.\nOn Monday, the Democrats presented a resolution to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president and the cabinet to declare Mr Trump unfit for office.\nThe resolution urged Mr Pence to \"declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the president is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office\".\nBut, as expected, the resolution was not adopted by unanimous consent in the House, after Republican Alex Mooney of West Virginia objected to the request.\nThe House has now gone into recess until Tuesday morning, when the chamber is expected to vote on the resolution.\nAfter the vote, the Democrats said they will give Mr Pence 24 hours to remove Mr Trump from office before they move toward impeachment.\n\"The president's threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,\" Speaker Pelosi said.\nAlthough Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment.\nImpeachments are usually long, drawn-out affairs, involving investigations and hearings that can take weeks to conclude. This impeachment is expected to be much quicker. \nMonday's presentation of the impeachment article to the House paves the way for a vote to be held. A simple majority in favour of impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Senate.\nHowever, an internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires.\nThe Senate is currently not in session, and all 100 senators would have to agree to change the schedule, which is highly unlikely.\nConstitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial when Mr Trump leaves office. But Democrats appear confident that the House can impeach Mr Trump and send the articles to the Senate for a trial at a later date.\nOn Sunday, Democratic House whip James Clyburn said the party may not send any articles to the Senate for trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office.\nIt's a new week in Washington DC, but the fallout from Wednesday's tragic events are just beginning.  \nWith only eight days left of Mr Trump's presidency, Democrats are very aware of the disruption an impeachment and a Senate trial would cause to the early days of Mr Biden's administration.\nThat's why there is talk of delaying Mr Trump's Senate trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office. \nAt that point, the pressure to remove Mr Trump will be past, but other punishments - stripping him of the accommodations and privileges ex-presidents enjoy and prohibiting him from future federal office - still apply.\nA year ago, Senate Republicans voted as a block to acquit the president of impeachment charges. This time, however, there may be some willing to side with Democrats to make sure that Trump, once out of power, never returns again."},

There were 112 positive cases at the 66 EFL clubs in its most recent round of testing. \nThe Football Association will be reminding everyone of their responsibilities.\nIt is understood there are no plans to halt elite sport but government ministers are concerned that the images from dressing rooms could make it harder to defend its continuation. \nA Whitehall source confirmed to the BBC that the celebrations at Chorley and Crawley Town had been noted by ministers, who last week warned football's authorities they had to do all they could to justify elite sport carrying on.\nIn his letter written to clubs on Monday, seen by BBC Sport, EFL chief executive Birch also said: \"Throughout the pandemic, football has provided a glimmer of hope for many millions of people affected by restrictions but we all understand the scrutiny the game remains under.\n\"While football is permitted to continue the actions of all participants will clearly be under the microscope. \n\"I am therefore personally asking you to re-double your efforts, to check, amend and tighten your protocol accordingly, and ensure that players and staff are left in no doubt as to their responsibilities on matchdays.\"\nProfessor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told BBC Breakfast that allowing team sports to continue was \"a balancing act\".\n\"The balancing act is trying to minimise the amount of contact outside very structured environments while trying to keep some semblance of life as will all know it,\" he said.  \n\"It is very much a matter for individuals in their day-to-day life. We have all got to say what, in our own lives, can we do to minimise the amount of impact we have on the NHS and the vulnerable?\"\nElite sport is not quite in the last-chance saloon, but the exemption it has been granted, at a time when grassroots sport has had to stop, cannot be taken for granted. \nA suspension is not yet imminent, but there are also no guarantees, especially if infection rates continue to rise, hospitals become overwhelmed, and the national lockdown has to be strengthened further. The government's patience seems to be wearing thin after the scenes of crowded dressing-room celebrations made a mockery of the social-distancing protocols that clubs were reminded of. \nThe optics of on-field hugs and handshakes, and fans gathering outside grounds, beamed into millions of homes at a time when the government is desperate for the public to stay at home and avoid contact with other households, is highly unhelpful to those making the case for professional sport to be allowed to continue. \nMy understanding is that ministers and medical experts' concerns do not amount to a final warning; they realise that the coverage of elite sport encourages people to stay at home and helps to retain some normality and balance in people's lives, and that protocols have largely been successful in suppressing transmission around training and fixtures. \nBut having warned sports bodies of their responsibilities last week, the government does now expect to see the football authorities in particular redouble their efforts, and for players' behaviour to reflect the privilege they enjoy in being able to continue to work when there has been so much disruption in so many people's work and lives. \nCertainly, football can ill afford any more high-profile breaches of the guidelines by players when away from their clubs.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the rules around celebrations in particular could be \"difficult to understand\".\n\"To control emotions when you are playing at 200mph is very difficult,\" he said on Monday.\n\"We are asking our players at corners, for example, to be man-marking people, pushing people around and not fist-bump anyone.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola voiced similar concerns, saying: \"When one guy scores a goal, I don't know if they can be controlled and not celebrate it.\n\"The joy to celebrate it, I don't know if [a player] is going to think: 'I cannot hug my mate for two, three seconds'.\"\nWolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo described the increase of cases as \"scary\".\n\"What I'm afraid of is the decision to stop - football as we know now will not be the same,\" he said.\n\"This is my biggest fear because the schedule will go crazy.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said: \"Everyone knows the situation and if it gets suspended I don't think it'd be a surprise.\n\"We'll just go with what the Government and Premier League have to say and, if it's the case to carry on, we'll carry on.

They also allege that Steinmetz forged documents linked to the deal.\nThe BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says Ms Toure has been described as the star witness for the prosecution, but her presence in court is unlikely - she now lives in the United States. She has not yet commented on this trial.\nMr Bonnant told Reuters news agency last month that Steinmetz had \"never paid a cent to Mme Mamadie Toure\" and said she was not married to Lansana Conte. \"She is not a public agent and therefore cannot be corrupted,\" he said.\nDespite its vast natural resources, Guinea remains one of the poorest countries in Africa, and has gained little from the Simandou iron ore riches. \nSteinmetz secured the rights in exchange for an investment of around $160m, but he then sold half of them on to Brazilian multinational mining company, Vale, 18 months later for $2.5bn, netting a massive profit.\nAt the time it was referred to as a \"jackpot\" deal in the financial press. But it also raised questions about why the initial rights were granted so cheaply. \nMo Ibrahim, the Sudanese telecom billionaire and anti-corruption campaigner, asked at the time: \"Are the Guineans who did that deal idiots, or criminals, or both?\"\nSteinmetz has always insisted he did nothing wrong. In a rare interview in 2012 he told the Financial Times that \"people don't like success\" and it was normal to pursue \"opportunities in an aggressive way\".\nGuinea's government stripped BSGR of its mining rights in 2014, citing evidence of corruption, which the company denied."},

But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents.\nDuring the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of him stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\" \nFor this revolutionary the harvest is still not over.\nMy introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out. \nThe piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings.\nIt is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity.\nHe is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure.\nMany young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language).\nBut the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around. \nIn his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the last election, he has been traversing the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets.\nAnd with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni has been keen to show his vitality. Last April, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November. \n\"If your father loves you, he has to empower you. In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern.\nThe economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power.\nOne of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty. \n\"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says.\n\"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent\u2026 he is an Africanist.\"\nNevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005.\nIndeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm.\nJournalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life.\n\"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote.\nBut something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits. \nHe had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age. \nAnd then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building. \nMany saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life.\nIt is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president. \nThe significance of patronage extends right through society.\nIt sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution.\nBut his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years.\n\"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council.\nWhile acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\".\nDespite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority.\nThe judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government. \nWhen judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.\nFor example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. \n\"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple.\nWhen it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment.\nThe media has also had its independence threatened.\nOn the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni. \n\"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala.\nBut outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds.\nBut perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered.\nAs it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents.\nKizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, once Mr Museveni's physician, first ran against him in the 2001 election. He has been detained and prosecuted on numerous charges, including rape and treason, but has never been convicted.\nNow that Bobi Wine, a singer whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is mounting a serious challenge to the president's rule, he has become the latest politician to face the wrath of the men in uniform.\nThe MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped. \nOn the campaign trail for this election, the police have arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups.\nDuring two days of protests in November following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces.\nSticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face.\nThrough his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control. He has also managed to reinvent himself. \nWhereas he was once the political upstart in his early 40s, anyone taking on that role now risks incurring his considerable wrath."},

But don't assume this is some symbol of encroaching hipster health food globalisation: in fact, centuries before it was deemed a \"superfood\", the vibrantly coloured cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae) \u2013 which grows primarily in warm alkaline lakes, ponds and rivers in the tropics and subtropics \u2013 was a pre-Hispanic dietary staple.\nThe Mexica \u2013 or Aztecs, as they were later known \u2013 harvested the protein-rich substance from the surface of Lake Texcoco, an expansive body of water in central Mexico that was later largely drained by the Spanish to make way for the construction of Mexico City. Here, the waters exhibited the perfect balance of salinity and alkalinity for spirulina to flourish. The Mexica called the foodstuff \ntecuitlatl\n, a Nahuatl word that roughly translates to \"rock excrement\", though they held it in decidedly higher esteem than its name suggests.\n\"Oral traditions say that the Mexica couriers and runners in ancient Tenochtitlan would eat dried spirulina cakes with corn, tortillas, beans, chillies or mole as fuel for long-distance travel,\" said Denise Vallejo, an indigenous first-generation Xicana chef who runs the vegan Los Angeles pop-up \nAlchemy Organica\n.\nEven without modern science, the Mexica could recognise the nutrient density that has made spirulina such a favourite today. It boasts about 60-70% protein by weight and has essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals, especially iron, manganese and B vitamins, according to the Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements. It's so healthy and relatively easy to grow, in fact, that \nexperts think it could be a potential food source for future Mars colonies\n.\nOf course, to the arriving Spanish conquistadors in the 16th Century, it mostly just looked odd. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo wrote in his 1568 memoir about \"a species of bread made of a kind of mud or slime collected from the surface of the lake, and eaten in that form, and has a similar taste to our cheese.\" And Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan included illustrations of spirulina harvesting in his 16th-Century ethnographic study, the Florentine Codex.\n\"After the Spanish invasion, most of its consumption declined with the draining of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico,\" Vallejo said. \"And many of the Spanish didn't enjoy its 'cheesy' or 'slimy' properties. Knowledge of its consumption was lost for a long time.\"\nThe Western world rediscovered the nutritious ingredient in the 1940s, when a French phycologist (a scientist who studies algae) noticed the Kanembu people along Africa's Lake Chad harvesting spirulina and turning it into sun-dried cakes called \ndih\u00e9\n. But it didn't make its grand return to Mexico until a happy accident in the 1960s, when the owners of Sosa Texcoco \u2013 which produced sodium carbonate and calcium chloride in a large snail-shaped pond on the remnants of Lake Texcoco \u2013 noticed a green substance mucking up the works. They reached out to French researchers, who concluded that it was the same organism that had been nourishing the Kanembu for generations. Rather than try to eradicate the cyanobacteria, Sosa Texcoco recognized its value, encouraged its growth and opened the world's first commercial spirulina company, Spirulina Mexicana.\nWhile Spirulina Mexicana has since closed, a micro-farm on the outskirts of San Miguel de Allende called \nSpirulina Viva\n is continuing the ancient tradition. Since 2010, American expat Katie Kohlstedt and her San Luis Potos\u00ed-born husband, Francisco Portillo, have grown fresh spirulina that probably tastes remarkably similar to what the Mexica harvested centuries ago. \"We're really proud to grow it here,\" she said. \"We didn't have to invent something new or bring something from somewhere else.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\n\u2022 \nMexico's ancient caviar\n\u2022 \nWhere there's no queso in quesadilla\n\u2022 \nMexico City's walking fish\nWhile many people may be familiar with spirulina in its dehydrated powdered form, Spirulina Viva sells the green stuff raw and frozen, which imparts a much more delicate flavour. \"Fresh spirulina should be creamy like a spreadable cheese,\" Kohlstedt said. \"If you closed your eyes, you might think you were eating a cross between an avocado and spinach.\" She noted that if you think of spirulina as fishy or an acquired taste, chances are you've been buying a lesser-quality product \u2013 or even one that uses ground fish bones to provide the phosphorus the spirulina needs to grow.\nKohlstedt and Portillo lead spirulina-growing workshops and have welcomed future farmers from as far away as Australia and Argentina. \"It's gardening combined with chemistry,\" Kohlstedt said of the process. But for many consumers, the finished product still remains a bit of a mystery. \"If I read one more article that said spirulina is grown in the ocean or [that shows] a picture of seaweed, I'm just going to scream,\" she said, with a laugh. \"My other two least favourite words are 'pond scum'. I think that's really offensive actually!\"\nKohlstedt recommends eating spirulina as simply as possible, stirred into warm miso soup or bone broth, blended into a smoothie, spread on bread or mixed into guacamole with extra lime juice, because vitamin C has been shown to help iron absorption. \"You're going to feel like you just ate Popeye's lunch,\" she said.\nIn Mexico City, chefs are getting even more creative with the ingredient. You might find spirulina dusting a tlayuda topped with avocado and \nescamoles \n(ant larvae) at \nBalc\u00f3n del Z\u00f3calo\n; brightening a superfood tortilla at \nCintli Tortilleria\n; adding a verdant punch to the smoothie bowls and cheesecakes at \nVegamo\n; and even spiking cocktails at the pre-Hispanic-inspired \nXam\na\nn Bar\n.\nThere, head bartender Kenneth Rodrigez has incorporated spirulina into a number of drinks, including a gin-based cocktail with Mexican lime and asparagus liqueur. \"I use it when somebody doesn't like egg whites or [in drinks for] vegan people, because spirulina has protein and we can get interesting textures,\" Rodrigez said, \"not to mention the incredible colour and the nutritional components that it provides.\"\u00a0\nHe describes the taste notes as \"green, herbal and \nclorofila \n(chlorophyll),\" and said that \"it can be used to enhance other flavours, because it has lots of minerals, like an alternative for salt.\"\u00a0\nAcross the border in Mexican American communities, using spirulina has meant establishing a direct connection with a pre-Hispanic past. At San Antonio's inventive Mexican restaurant \nMixtli\n, for instance, chefs Rico Torres and Diego Galicia featured spirulina on a special menu inspired by the Spanish conquest, and they participated in a collaborative D\u00eda de los Muertos dinner at New York's \nJames\nBeard House\n, where one of the hors d'oeuvres was a smoked spirulina yogurt with trout roe and radishes.\nAt Alchemy Organica, Vallejo incorporates spirulina powder into a pineapple \nagua fresca\n (a Mexican drink made with water, sugar and pureed fruits, seeds, flowers or grains for flavour) with lime and chia seeds. And she has even used it as \"a natural food colouring and nutritional boost, along with cactus and spinach powders\" to make vibrant green \nmasa\n (dough made with corn that has been nixtamalized, or treated with an alkaline solution), which she turns into colourful tortillas and tamales. \"I also use it as a flavour enhancer for some of my seafood-inspired dishes, as it imparts a flavour much like seaweed,\" she explained.\u00a0\nAnd when one of her cooks began selling fresh spirulina at a farmer's market, Vallejo took to simply scooping spoonfuls into her drinks. \"It gives you energy like you'd expect from a cup of coffee!\" she said.\nIn a sense, these chefs are tapping into something much deeper than simply taste or nutrition. Vallejo, who studies \ncuranderismo \n(folk medicine), said that spirulina is often viewed as a detoxifier to prepare for rituals, spells and \"visionary plant ceremonies\". And Kohlstedt has similarly heard about the ingredient's mystical connections, which draw on the similarities between spirulina's helical shape and our own building blocks as humans: \"Someone told me that the reason it's called 'spirulina' has to do with its spiral form, but that it also has to do with our DNA and how there is something really basic and spiritual about how we relate to plants [and cyanobacteria].\"\n\"So many of the 'superfoods' enjoyed today have a rich history in Mesoamerica: chia, amaranth, cacao, avocado, cactus,\" Vallejo noted. \"I think the current decolonising movement in Xicanx, Central American and other Spanish-speaking communities is helping us to rediscover and remember our ancestral foodways. We get to take back our foods and our plant wisdom.

She got a lot of support \u2013 but she also still faces struggles.\u00a0\nA woman at a party insisted she could never pronounce Duncan\u2019s full first name, laughing instead at how different it was and asking where she was from. \u201cShe really, really acted like I had just come from another country\u2026 I really felt like I was so foreign to her,\u201d says Duncan, who has lived in Toronto for more than 40 years. At another get-together, a guest explained that her name was hard to pronounce and unilaterally reverted to \u2018Nana\u2019 instead.

Production will begin in late spring.\nThe trailer for the HBO Max show gives nothing away; It features numerous shots of New York, but none of the characters is seen on screen. \n\"I grew up with these characters, and I can't wait to see how their story has evolved in this new chapter, with the honesty, poignancy, humour and the beloved city that has always defined them,\" Sarah Aubrey, head of original content at HBO Max, said in a statement.\nThe original Sex and the City series, created by Darren Star, was based on Candace Bushnell's 1997 book of the same name. It premiered on HBO in 1998 and ran for six seasons until 2004.\nThe show inspired two films, Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010. A prequel series titled The Carrie Diaries, starring Anna Sophia Robb, aired on The CW in 2013/14. \nStar also created Netflix show \n, and many have drawn \n between that show and SATC.\nWhen it first burst on to our TV screens, Sex and the City was seen as revolutionary - four women talking openly about their love and sex lives, not to mention the sex scenes themselves.\nCosmopolitans and rabbit vibrators were trending before trending was a thing.\nWhile it was praised by many for its liberating female-led content, it also attracted criticism from some quarters who felt Carrie's ongoing pursuit of Mr Big (Christopher Noth) was not exactly an advert for female independence.\nIt was also accused of \n such as sexual harassment and for its \n, a criticism levelled at many older shows \nFashion was a hugely influential part of the series - the tutu worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in the opening credits, teamed with a fur coat and heels, was described as \nAnd Manolo Blahnik could never have dreamed of attracting so much publicity for his designer footwear.\nIt was a ratings smash, with the hotly anticipated finale in 2004 \nIn the UK, the final episode was \n.\nThe series was predictably most popular in the 18-34 age group.\nMany SATC fans will be disappointed that larger-than-life favourite Samantha Jones - played by Kim Cattrall - will not be returning for the sequel series.\nSamantha was Sex and the City's most outlandish character and arguably, the star of the show.\nWhile Miranda was juggling a career and motherhood, Charlotte was focused on marriage and motherhood and Carrie poured her neuroses into her New York Star column, Samantha was the character perhaps harder to relate to but someone we all wanted to be (at least a little).\nShe was fiercely independent and while caring for her friends, she always put her own needs before men.\nBut news Cattrall won't reprise the role in And Just Like That comes as no surprise after years of feud rumours which were later confirmed by the British-born Canadian actress.\nIn 2017, \n she had \"never been friends\" with her co-stars.\nShe said there was a \"toxic relationship\" and ruled out appearing in a third Sex and the City movie, denying that her decision was down to pay or \"diva\" demands.\nCattrall commented that former co-star Parker \"could have been nicer\" about the situation.\nA different actress could play Samantha in the future, she suggested.\n\"I played it past the finish line and then some and I loved it and another actress should play it,\" she said. \"Maybe they could make it an African-American Samantha Jones or a Hispanic Samantha Jones, or bring in another character.\"\nShe later \n after she sent condolences following the death of Cattrall's brother.\nIn an interview with \n shortly afterwards, SJP acknowledged Cattrall \"said things that were really hurtful about me\".\nParker said: \"So there was no fight; it was completely fabricated, because I actually never responded.\"\nOn Monday, \n to someone posting that SJP \"didn't tag Samantha Jones\" into her post announcing the new series.\n\"I don't dislike her. I've never said that. Never would. Samantha isn't part of this story. But she will always be part of us. No matter where we are or what we do. x.\" "},

Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it.\nBluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features.\nRaising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well.\nWi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in. \nConnecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers.\nUsing a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale.\nWorldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, \n.\nSmartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia.\nTaiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step.\nBut some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough.\nAs principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks.\nHe says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems. \n\"I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely.\"\nThere is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability. \n\"Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,\" he says.\nAnother challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi. \n\"Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,\" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks.\n\"The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,\" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly. \nOne solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection.\nIt can also be tricky to install smart locks.\nYale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws. \nHelpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky.\n\"I'm a bit of a door nerd now,\" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks.\nFor fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy. \nOne workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether. \nA server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. \"The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,\" she says. \nLock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens. \nSome want an \"active command and control experience\" using Siri or Alexa. \nBut others long for locks to \"do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,\" he says.\nIf we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in.\nThey can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.\nIf you, or someone you know, are affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) "},

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Atlanta and Feud: Bette and Joan. \nThe Sex Pistols electrified British music and, depending on who you believed, threatened the very fabric of society at the tail end of the 1970s. \nThey may only have survived for two years, but their angry, nihilistic singles and violent performances changed the idea of what rock and roll could be. \nOriginally formed in 1972 by Jones and drummer Paul Cook, they were galvanized by the addition of John Lydon - aka Johnny Rotten - whose abrasive vocals and anti-establishment lyrics defined the band and, to a large extent, the British punk movement.\nThey only released one album, but the sheer sonic force of songs like Anarchy In The UK, God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant became symbols of Britain's social and political turmoil, as youth unemployment soared, with young people particularly affected.\nNot that everyone was impressed by the Sex Pistols' curious combination of anger and apathy. \nTheir singles were blacklisted on the British charts and a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying their album cover. Facing bans across the UK, the group had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. - \"Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly\".\nAlways on the verge of chaos, they finally split up on a US tour in 1978. \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" a tired and disillusioned Johnny Rotten asked the audience at their final show - but their legacy was ensured.\n\"Imagine breaking into the world of The Crown and Downton Abbey with your mates and screaming your songs and your fury at all they represent,\" said Boyle, announcing his new project. \n\"This is the moment that British society and culture changed forever. It is the detonation point for British street culture... where ordinary young people had the stage and vented their fury and their fashion\u2026and everyone had to watch and listen\".\nThe series is based on Steve Jones's memoir, Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol; which doesn't just focus on his time with the band.\nIt begins in West London, where the young musician suffered maternal neglect and sexual abuse by a step-father, and quickly fell into crime - including an attempt to climb the chimneys of Battersea Power Station, and stealing amps from a David Bowie gig.\nAfter becoming entranced by the glam rock scene, he is taken under the wings of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who helped form, style and promote the Sex Pistols.\nThe book demystifies the band behind the myth - showing how they struggled with the criticisms lobbed their way and the pressure of living up to their image, including the moment Jones was goaded into swearing live on primetime TV.\nLater chapters deal with his battles with addiction, and his recent reinvention as a tee-total \"semi-retired sexual deviant who doesn't really act out so much any more\".\nBritish-born, Australian-raised actor Toby Wallace will play Jones, following eye-catching roles in the coming-of-age drama Babyteeth and Netflix drama The Society, where he played evil teen Campbell Elliot.\nAnson Boon, last seen in the Kate Winslet tear-jerker Blackbird takes on the spittle-flecked role of Johnny Rotten; while out-of-control bassist Sid Vicious will be played by Louis Partridge.\nSydney Chandler - daughter of film star Kyle - will become Pretenders star Chrissie Hynde, who had an affair with Jones at the height of the Sex Pistols' fame.\nThe Witcher's Emma Appleton is cast as Nancy Spungen, the American girlfriend of Sid Vicious, who died in mysterious circumstances in October 1978.\nAnd Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams plays \"the face of punk\", the iconoclastic model and actress Pamela Rooke, whose signature style - ripped fishnets, dominatrix heels and raccoon-like eye make-up - defined the scene.\nThe Sex Pistols project isn't the only musical series in the pipeline.

The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals.\nPCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment.\nA series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity.\nThe chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea.\nPCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises.\nOne killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded.\nAlthough levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely.\nPCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life. \nA recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a \"cocktail of pollutants\", which are passed down from mother to calf.\nScientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain.\nIn humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality.\nStrandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast.\nThe deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections.\nIn the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades.\nThe study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility.\n\"Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,\" said Rosie Williams.\nPopulations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility.\n\"This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,\" she said.\n\"That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals.\"\nThere are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber.\nThe study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.\nFollow Helen on \n."},

I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual.\nBut then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read. \nWith a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now.\nParler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too.\nTechnology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons.\n\"Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,\" she said.\nIt's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too.\nAgain, this is not unheard of. \nGab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days.\nWhat is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president.\nSince Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch.\nYouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance.\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as \"problematic\".\nEU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as \"the 9/11 moment of social media\", \n that \"the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing\".\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now \"taking editorial decisions\", adding that platforms were \"choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice\".\nElsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship.\nHe tweeted: \"The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship.\"\nThe fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter.\nOne of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse.\nPlatforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies.\nBut since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders.\nIn March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation.\nIt wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence.\nThe president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\".\nSocial media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets \"a pivotal precedent\" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post.\nSome analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide.\nOn Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election.\nPrivacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants. \n\"Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world. I think the president's removal might be the beginning of a purge for similar behaviour globally.\"\nIn his final hours on Twitter, Mr Trump once again blamed a piece of US legislation called Section 230 for \"banning\" free speech. During his presidency he threatened to repeal the law which makes social networks largely exempt from liability for their users' post.\nMany argue that removing the protection would actually harm free speech as networks would be forced to moderate far more than they currently do.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden has also stated that he would like to repeal the law to increase moderation and reduce the spread of fake news.\nIn the same final tweet Mr Trump said that he has been negotiating with \"various other sites\" and that there would be \"a big announcement soon\".\nIf the events of recent days are anything to go by, Mr Trump and some of his supporters face an uphill struggle against not just lawmakers but tech giants too before they can establish themselves on mainstream social media."},
{"title": "Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55575756", "tag": "news", "tag2": "world-europe", "author": "N/A", "article_text": "\nMember states decide individually who to vaccinate, when and where, but the EU is coordinating strategy and buying vaccines in bulk. On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021.\nBBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch.\nThe fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation.\nA recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground.\nVaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than\nfirst doses had been administered. \nBut some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses.\nMuch of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order.\nGermany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. \nMr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand.\nGermany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer.\nThe Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager.\nBut the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. \"We believed when we contributed \u20ac12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,\" he told a newspaper this week.\nThe country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to \n people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. \nIt has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature.\nHowever, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer.\nFrance's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to \n - still so small as to be statistically meaningless.  \nSo why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used.\nThe primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. \nEach recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives.\nAnother problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers.\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings.\nPolitically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a \"state scandal\", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free.\nRussia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity.\nSputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded.\nA poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week that \n had been vaccinated.\nBut one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown.\nRussia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped.\nAlmost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is still \nof how many others have received the vaccination. \nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains \"feasible\". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. \nAlongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February.\nSwedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine.\nA successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. \nMeanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands.\nIt seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further \nelderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial.\nThe mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be \"seamless and fast\", tweeting: \"If that does not work, shoot me.\"\nThe first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September.\nYou may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed.\nAfter getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its \"careful\" approach.\nAnd there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. \nIn a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least.\nSpain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with \npeople vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. \nEach of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. \nGovernment data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. \nAlthough vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination.\nHowever, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. \nThe arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by \"political affiliations or parliamentary needs\", a claim the central government has rejected.

But it says the design has \"great potential\".\nOne day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet.\nIn traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky.\nUnder a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload.\nMaveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\"There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,\" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant.\n\"We believe that we have to go into a really\u2026 breakthrough technology,\" she says.\nAn equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.\nResearchers there are working on a design known as the \"Flying-V\". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350.\nLike Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves.\nThe designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be \"plugged\" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once.\n\"We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,\" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology.\nThe design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany.\nThe flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success.\nResearchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as \"Dutch roll\". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as \"a somewhat rough landing\" that damaged the front landing gear.\nData from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator.\nAirlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V.\nThe attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact.\nBut with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as \"showstoppers\".\nAmong them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency.\nThere's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the \"wing\" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal.\nBuilding a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region.\n\"That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,\" says Mr Wright.\nAirbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer.\nIts rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing.\nAircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier.\nBoeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design.\nBut current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at \n - are based on proving that concept.\nFor longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power.\nOne major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane.\nBut the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities.\nThose priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion.\nAirbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power.\nIn September, Airbus \n.\nHydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing.\nBut there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide.\nIn order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution.\n\"Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,\" he explains."},

But it just kept not being ok,\" she says.\n\"I wasn't planning on leaving at all,\" she adds. \"It was a complete switch.\"\nSince March, property firms and moving companies have reported a rush of demand from people leaving New York, many of them young families, as the pandemic drives demand for bigger homes and more outdoor space, while making relocation easier by expanding remote work.\nAnd so far, the surge hasn't shown signs of slowing, says Liz Nunan, president of property firm Houlihan Lawrence, which handles home sales in suburbs around New York City, and reported its best year on record in 2020.\n\"One of the things I learned in 2020 is that I have no idea what the future holds, but I feel rather bullish on 2021,\" she says. \"I believe we'll have a year that's nearly as strong as 2020 turned out to be.\"\nLast year, longer distance relocations from New York City helped push New York the state to the biggest population decline of any in the US, putting it on track for its first population fall of any decade since the 1970s. \nThe signs of outflow have spawned a small universe of articles debating whether New York City is dead or dying, and what - if anything - should be done to help it recover. \nAnd as the US confronts an economic crisis likely to outlast the pandemic that precipitated it, such concerns are not unique to the US's largest city.\nSmaller downtowns across the country have watched in despair as signs of long-sought revival - new restaurants, businesses in formerly abandoned buildings - disappear almost overnight.\n\"This is a difficult time for everybody,\" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank. \"The real issue is: can these cities hold their economic vitality?\" \nIn New York, the pandemic has closed theatres, emptied offices, halted tourism, and turned shopping and dining into hazards to be undertaken at your own risk, gutting industries that employed a fifth of the city's workforce.\nAs many as a third of the city's small businesses may not survive the pandemic, according to estimates by local business group, the Partnership for New York City. Most companies in the city's downtown do not expect staff to ever return to the office in full force. Some firms have already left.\nThe situation has \n - almost double the national average - swollen the ranks of the homeless, and helped spur the departure of more than 300,000 people like Andrea, further straining public finances.\nIn response, New York leaders have raised the prospect of increasing taxes and cutting services like transportation, garbage collection and park maintenance, while begging for emergency aid from Washington to resolve financial woes - pleas that so far have fallen on deaf ears.\nMichael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at the free market Manhattan Institute think tank, worries the potential cuts will further accelerate the outflow, hurting the very amenities that make city life attractive and leaving a poorer city for those who remain.\n\"It's not really so much the pandemic that is the greatest challenge to New York City,\" he says. \"It's really the second order consequences that have dealt a blow to the city's recovery and its citizens.\n\"New York is not dead, but it is on life support,\" he says. \"Whether its recovery is measured in months or years or decades is primarily determined by the degree of leadership that we see in the city. And I think that's why we should be so concerned.\"\nIn some ways, such worries are uniquely American, reflecting the safety woes and weak educational systems that set so many US cities apart from counterparts in Europe and Canada, says Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto. He predicts that coronavirus outflow from cities outside the US will be less dramatic and more temporary.\nIn the US, however, the urban revival of the early 2000s had shown signs of fading even before the pandemic, as immigration waned and moves to the suburbs accelerated. \nIn New York, the population has been falling since 2016.\nThe expansion of remote work caused by the pandemic means the city is now competing with even more places for businesses and families - trends that are unlikely to fully reverse even after life returns to normal, Prof Florida says.\n\"Talented people have choice now with remote work. Those choices will be made carefully,\" he says. \"The big winners are places with a lot of amenity, and the premium for amenity will grow. That means cities with wonderful coast lines or rural areas near mountains. Places like Miami Beach, or Bozeman, Montana, or Aspen, Colorado, or the Hudson Valley of New York.\" \nAndrea, who initially decamped to her mother's home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says she hasn't entirely written off New York. But for now, she's planning a cross-country road trip, working remotely while scoping out new cities to potentially call home.  \n\"I'm going to hop in the car\u2026 and drive around the country, and see if anything feels like a fit,\" she says. \"If it doesn't, then I'll see where the world is in September.\"\nKevin Pearsall and his wife left New York City in March for Atlanta, Georgia. After years of focusing on their careers in advertising, the 35-year-old says they wanted a hometown where they didn't feel like housing and other living costs remained a stretch - even on their healthy six-figure salaries.\nThey both landed jobs as remote workers for New York firms - another sign that convinced them the city was no longer the only place they could combine professional opportunity and social life.\n\"All of the great things about New York - speakeasies, beer gardens... that's not really as unique as it used to be,\" he says.\n\"We were already in motion, thinking about leaving,\" he says. The pandemic \"just accelerated\" the move.\nNew York leaders have expressed confidence that the city will remain a draw, noting that outflow of a few hundred thousand hardly makes a dent in a city of more than eight million. \n\"I'm not going to beg people to stay,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last year. \"I know this city will rebound. I know it. And I know others will come. They have for generations.\" \n\"We can't overrate this moment in history,\" he added. \"It is a passing moment. There will be a vaccine. And then all the strengths of New York City will reassert again.\"\nHow it will shake out in the long term remains a question.\nThe neighbourhoods that emptied during lockdowns last year were the city's wealthiest, but a Manhattan Institute survey this summer found that \n with dissatisfaction highest among those with lower incomes.\nMr Hendrix says it is tempting to hope a more affordable city will emerge if the rich depart, but he worries such an exodus will generate still more challenges, given how dependent the city is on high earners for tax revenue.\n\"It doesn't take a majority leaving the city or a majority changing their lifestyle to make a big difference,\" he says.\n is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nProf Florida says the biggest cities, like New York and San Francisco, are likely to remain a draw for young people, who should benefit if rents continue to fall. \nBut he warns that such declines were short-lived after previous crises. And elsewhere in America, he expects downtown business districts - \n - to face major challenges.\n\"The central business districts - those places which packed and stacked knowledge workers in the vertical towers - they are in for a real reckoning,\" he says.

In this image, the oil paintings of political figures in the background emphasise this imagery of the past.\nThere have been renewed calls for the Confederate flag to be banned across the US following the anti-racism protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, a black man.\nHowever Mr Trump has defended use of the flag, calling it a matter of free speech.\nOne man in a Trump beanie here walks between the red guide ropes, as many visitors might do on a guided-tour to view the Crypt, the Statuary Hall and the Rotunda.\nBut this man is carrying a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, as he poses in front of a painting depicting the surrender of Gen Burgoyne in the war of independence. \nAnother man, identified as Jake Angeli, an ardent Trump supporter who has attended a number of the president's rallies, shouts as he makes his way to the Senate Chamber. \nHis incongruous garments set him apart from other protesters wearing black hoodies. These Trump activists stand by taking selfies, but he has clearly come here to be photographed by others.\nThe apparent lack of a security presence is in sharp contrast to other Washington protests where there is a highly visible presence of heavily armed security forces protecting US institutions.\nAnother Trump supporter, identified as Richard Barnett, sits with one boot disrespectfully on a desk that is at the very centre of power in Congress. It is in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \nIn the scene, unimaginable days earlier, Barnett in his baseball cap and checked shirt resembles a raconteur regaling friends with tales of his exploits. \nThe image went viral as did pictures of the notes he and others left on Ms Pelosi's desk.\nThis dramatic image shows how the formal proceedings came to a violent halt as Capitol police officers drew their guns on doors being attacked by protesters intent on entering the House Chamber.\nMany commentators asked if they were watching a coup unfold as doors were barricaded and firearms brandished.\nThe composition is reminiscent of a scene in a Hollywood Western, the lawmen bracing for the doors to be breached.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden made an impassioned TV address describing the scenes as \"an assault on democracy\" - this chilling picture encapsulates what he meant.

Mr Wolf last week called on Mr Trump to \"strongly condemn\" the protesters who stormed Congress.\nThe outgoing secretary said his departure had been prompted by \"recent events\", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment.\nLaw enforcement around the country are said to be bracing for the possibility of further violence in the days before Joe Biden takes office. \nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.   \n around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. \nCalls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots.\nLocal police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses following last week's violence, according to US media. \nThe Reuters news agency, citing a federal law enforcement official, said the FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. \nAlthough the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were reported elsewhere in the country at the same time.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday that it would begin National Special Security Event (NSSE) operations for the inauguration six days early, starting Wednesday.\nThe designation allows a wide range of security and law enforcement agencies to coordinate together on special protective measures, like enforcing road closures and a secure perimeter.\nThe announcement came after Washington DC's Mayor, Ms Bowser, went public with her appeal to bolster security after what she described as an \"unprecedented terrorist attack\" at the US Capitol last week.\nShe has also asked Americans to avoid travel to Washington DC for the event. Inaugurations traditionally draw hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital, but the coronavirus pandemic had already curtailed those plans before security fears were heightened. \nThe Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, said Monday that 10,000 troops will be in Washington DC by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested by local officials.\nElsewhere, the National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid \"credible threats\" of further violence.  \n\"Groups involved in the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol continue to threaten to disrupt the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20,\" the service said in a statement, adding it could institute further temporary closures to other areas within the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \nSpeaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was \"not afraid\" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears.\nHis inauguration committee has announced that the ceremony will be themed around \"America United\". \nAfter being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. \nDonald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years not to do so.\nThe warnings about further pro-Trump violence come as efforts move forward to impeach the president for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol.\nAn article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" during a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was \"stolen\" from him. \nDemocrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office.\nMr Trump has made no public statements since \n - on Friday.\nIt comes as websites and social media networks crackdown against other users and websites seen to be encouraging violence - including social network Parler, \n.

The 76-year-old faces 10 challengers, most notably the pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine. \nHuman rights groups have accused security forces of using excessive force to break up opposition rallies during the campaign. But the government says the strong measures are necessary to ensure people comply with a ban on large crowds imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nHere are the five things you need to know about the crucial vote:\nPresident Museveni is one of the longest-serving presidents in Africa. He and his National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986 at the end of a five-year war, and have led Uganda ever since.\nHis supporters praise him for bringing relative peace and prosperity to the country, and in particular for his policies on health. He helped limit the spread of HIV, and more recently his harsh lockdown - which closed schools and business, banned vehicle movement and imposed mandatory public mask use in May - is credited with tackling the coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to Johns Hopkins University, \n and around just 300 deaths from the illness.\nBut while he was once hailed in the West as one of the new generation of African leaders, his critics accuse him of turning into another authoritarian leader. \nMr Museveni has no designated successor within his party, and in 2017 \n allowing him to run again for the presidency. \nHe has seen off a number of challengers to his rule over the years, notably long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was arrested numerous times and decided not to run again for the presidency in 2021. \nWhile Mr Museveni maintains a large support base, especially in rural areas, he is facing increasing opposition over rising inequality and his rigid control over the country.\nOne of 10 candidates challenging him for the presidency this year is musician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known by the stage name Bobi Wine. \nAffectionately referred to as the \"ghetto president\", the 38-year-old became an East African musical superstar in the early 2000s before switching to politics and winning a seat in parliament in 2017.\nBobi Wine is seen as the biggest challenge to Mr Museveni's rule and has mobilised many young people who have not previously been involved in politics. He has sharply criticised the president in the past and accused him of \"fearing the people\".\nThe president has not taken this challenge lightly. He has accused Bobi Wine of being a foreign agent of those \"who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda\" and said that opposition figures are misleading young people to get involved in violence on the campaign trail. \nBobi Wine has been arrested several times since he became involved in politics. He has spoken of a \"revolution\" against Mr Museveni. \n using the hashtag \"WeAreRemovingADictator\".\nPart of Bobi Wine's popularity comes down to his age. At 38, he is just half as old as President Museveni, in one of the youngest nations on earth. \n Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide, of just 15.7 - only Niger is younger. \nThe \"ghetto president\" grew up in a slum in the capital, Kampala. His background and his efforts to promote social justice in his country through his music and as a politician have endeared him to this younger, more urban generation. \nBut Bobi Wine has also surprised authorities by drawing big crowds of supporters in rural areas - thought to be a bastion of support for President Museveni.\nTensions are high, and the campaign has been marred by serious violence, which has left dozens killed and hundreds more arrested. \nOfficials have cited measures brought in to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic for their efforts to break up political gatherings. But \n that security forces are using these regulations \"as a pretext to violate rights and clamp down on the opposition and the media\". \n for allegedly breaching Covid measures. His detention sparked protest which led to a wave of arrests and left dozens dead, mostly allegedly shot by the security forces.\nAfterwards, \n and said \"police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence\".\n\"Can I repeat? Police have a right to shoot you and you die for nothing.... do it at your own risk.\"\nBobi Wine has since taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest and helmet on the campaign trail. \nAt the end of last year he halted his campaign after a number of his team were injured as security forces dispersed one of his political rallies. He later told broadcaster CNN he had survived several assassination attempts. \nA country of more than 42 million people, Uganda is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nIt has one of the highest refugee populations worldwide, hosting \n from neighbouring countries. \nSome are watching the political unrest in the country with concern, and worry about what could happen after the vote. There has never been a peaceful transfer of power in Uganda and it is not clear what would happen if Mr Museveni were to lose, and what the military would do.\nThe president announced a shake-up of the armed forces in November, bringing in the former head of Uganda's operations in Somalia, Maj Gen Paul Lokech, as deputy inspector general of police to coordinate security forces around the capital during the election period. \nThe European Union has chosen not to send observers to the election this year - reportedly because \n to make polling more fair - meaning there will be less international scrutiny.

The opposition says this is because it is popular in those areas, but the government says the measure is due to Covid-19 restrictions. \n\"We found this network to be linked to the government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda,\" Facebook said in a statement. \n\"They used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were,\" the statement continued. \nBut government spokesman Ofwono Opondo hit back in a \n, accusing Facebook of failing to adhere to \"natural justice\" and echoing suggestions by other government figures that the social network is trying to influence the election outcome. \n\"We are not familiar with anybody who complains about these accounts,\" he said. \"The owners have not received any notice and no-one was asked to make any response to the allegations.\"\nMr Opondo described Facebook as high-handed. \"I think they are playing the usual games,\" he added. \"We know that they have a side in this election perhaps.\" \nThe government spokesman said Thursday's elections would be free and fair.\nThe BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that the campaign period has been dominated by social media, as political parties moved to reach a young, politically aware population.\nMany new accounts promoting messages from both the ruling party and the opposition have popped up in the last couple of months, especially on Facebook and Twitter. In many cases, the users did not use proper names, and shared content filled with hate messages and fake news, she says. \nUgandans online have said saying that the government has finally got a taste of what it feels like to be censured.\nIn December, the Uganda Communications Commission, the media industry regulator, wrote to Google, asking it to shut down several YouTube channels associated with Bobi Wine.\nIn the past, the government body has ordered online content creators such as influencers and bloggers to register and have their material vetted before publication, but this was put on hold after it was challenged in court. \nDuring the 2016 election, the government blocked social media on polling day and for several after, which led to the proliferation of VPN use in the country.\nIt feels like there is a fresh wind blowing through social media in terms of how it deals with political content.\nFirst we saw US President Donald Trump banned from Twitter and Facebook and now that has been extended beyond the US to Africa. \nFacebook has shut a slew of accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials, accusing them of \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\" in the public debate ahead of Thursday's election.\nMark Zuckerberg has long insisted that the platform he founded has to allow all forms of free speech and cannot become an arbiter of political conversations.\nSo what has changed? The truth is that the platform has increasingly focused on misinformation in recent years but the violence and chaos witnessed at the heart of the US government in recent days have forced it to speed up these attempts, and make some pretty big decisions.\nThe days of describing itself as a mere conduit for content seem to be well and truly over.\nIt has tried lots of ways to reduce misinformation, including ranking reliable journalism higher than fake news and training algorithms to identify \"bad\" posts, but it has had mixed results.\nBut now with all eyes on it, it is going to have to find a way to deal with content in a way that pleases politicians, its users and its advertisers, who do not want to be associated with a platform that is being accused of inciting unrest or influencing the results of elections.\nIt remains unclear how it will do so in the long term but in the short term expect more knee-jerk reactions to political events around the world.\nAnd the new look for the social network will come at a price.\nSome Ugandan officials are already accusing it of meddling in its election. Facebook could be stuck between a rock and a hard place for some time to come."},

So I lowered the prices, as it was more important to protect people than to think of profit,\" the 35-year-old tells the BBC.\n\"I had to increase my production by 75% to meet the demand when the pandemic started, so Covid-19 has been good for my business.\n\"But I made sure I gave free soap to vulnerable people such as the elderly and the disabled.\"\nMr Havyarimana's initiative has been praised by the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, which often highlights the contribution of refugee entrepreneurs to their host communities.\n\"The refugees are playing a pivotal role in helping contain the spread of Covid-19 in Kakuma,\" Eujin Byun, a spokesperson for UNHCR in Kenya tells the BBC.\n\"They helped in many ways, from disseminating information about the virus to helping people take the necessary measures.\"\nShe added that she was not surprised by Mr Havyarimana's decision to lower prices.\n\"Refugees are very community-oriented and they will look after each other. They have previously stepped up and helped us do our jobs in situations like that.\"\nMr Havyarimana currently employs 42 people in his business, named Glap Industries - short for God Loves All People. The bulk of the workers are refugees but 18 are Kenyans from the town of Kakuma.\nGlap supplies local businesses and institutions outside the camp and even relief agencies.\n\"The agencies buy my soaps to give away to refugees who cannot afford them and for their own staff too,\" the Burundian proudly notes. \nMr Havyarimana is not the only local soap merchant, but he does not fear the competition, and in fact offers classes to teach people how to make cleaning products.\n\"I want to mentor women and younger people so they can have an opportunity to become self-reliant and improve their lives like I did,\" he says.\n\"I want to help the community in any way I can.\" \nEfforts like his may have helped keep Covid-19 at bay in Kakuma. \nThe most recent UNHCR figures, dating from 24 December, show that there had been 341 confirmed cases with 19 people under medical care. There have been 10 deaths from the virus.\nKenya has registered nearly 100,000 cases nationally, with around 1,700 deaths, health ministry figures show.\nPolitical instability and violence have forced more than 300,000 people to flee Burundi to neighbouring African countries in the last decade, according to the UNHCR.\nMr Havyarimana was in the middle of his chemistry studies at the University of Burundi when he left. He says his life was in danger and that he was receiving death threats from relatives of his late mother, who also seized his home.\nAfter arriving in Kakuma, he wanted to make money for himself, rather than relying on humanitarian aid.\nThe camp sits in an isolated and arid region where the provision of basic services is a challenge for relief agencies. \nExploring the region, Mr Havyarimana noticed there was not a soap factory, which meant that cleaning products had to be brought from elsewhere.\n\"I had no idea of how to make soap, so I started surfing the web for some knowledge,\" he explains.\nHe later enrolled in a soap-making course offered by the World Lutheran Federation aid agency, and with a loan from a former classmate in Burundi, he started the business alongside two helpers.\nHe also received grants from relief agencies including the UNHCR and NGOs such as the African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC), which says it has supported more then 18,000 refugee entrepreneurs.\n\"Innocent's story shows how refugees can contribute to their host communities in a number of ways,\" Julienne Oyler, the AEC's chair, tells the BBC.\n\"Camps like Kakuma are so isolated that entrepreneurs like him are a lifeline to basic goods and services at a time of lockdowns and other restrictions.\"\nA 2018 World Bank study identified over 2,000 businesses in Kakuma and estimated that they contributed more than $50m (\u00a337m) to the local economy every year.\nMichelle Richey, a lecturer in technology and entrepreneurship at the UK's Loughborough University specialising in refugee business ventures, says people like Mr Havyarimana are very import in changing the general perception of refugees.\n\"The human potential within refugees shows when we give them chances to work instead of just focusing on humanitarian issues,\" she says.\n\"We can help those people have some control of their lives again after all they have been through.\"\nStarting a thriving business is not the only change in Mr Havyarimana's life since arriving in Kakuma. In 2017, he married Aline, a fellow Burundian refugee he met at the camp. \nThey have two sons, and the youngest one, Prince, was born in late November. \nMr Havyarimana speaks with fondness about life in Kenya but he dreams of being resettled in Australia or Canada. \n\"I like Kakuma a lot, but I want to give my wife and kids a better life,\" he says.\nIn the meantime, Mr Havyarimana is focusing on expanding his ways to help the community, and as well as offering 21 kinds of soap and cleaning products, he has devised a hand sanitiser created from aloe vera grown in a patch just outside his workshop.\n\"Coronavirus has affected the whole world but for us here in Kakuma, it has made it even more important that we clean our hands in any we can,\" he says."},

Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony.\nThis is the second time Democrats have pursued impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nIn December 2019, the House impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020.\nNo US president has ever been impeached twice.\nHowever, the prospect of an impeachment conviction is unlikely because of Mr Trump's broad Republican support in the Senate.\nThe resolution drafted by three Democrats - who began writing it while under lockdown in the Capitol last Wednesday - consists of one article: \"Incitement of insurrection\".\n\"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,\" the resolution reads.\nIn the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in \"imminent lawless action at the Capitol\".\nThe resolution also says this was \"consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct\" the certification of President-elect Biden's election win.\n\"He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,\" the resolution says.\nImpeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial.\nArticles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial to decide whether to convict or not. There is no appeal against outcome.\nAn impeachment is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nMr Trump was the third US president to be impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were also left in office by the Senate.\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached in 1974, as political pressure built over the Watergate scandal.\nOn Monday, the Democrats presented a resolution to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president and the cabinet to declare Mr Trump unfit for office.\nThe resolution urged Mr Pence to \"declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the president is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office\".\nBut, as expected, the resolution was not adopted by unanimous consent in the House, after Republican Alex Mooney of West Virginia objected to the request.\nThe House has now gone into recess until Tuesday morning, when the chamber is expected to vote on the resolution.\nAfter the vote, the Democrats said they will give Mr Pence 24 hours to remove Mr Trump from office before they move toward impeachment.\n\"The president's threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,\" Speaker Pelosi said.\nAlthough Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment.\nImpeachments are usually long, drawn-out affairs, involving investigations and hearings that can take weeks to conclude. This impeachment is expected to be much quicker. \nMonday's presentation of the impeachment article to the House paves the way for a vote to be held. A simple majority in favour of impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Senate.\nHowever, an internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires.\nThe Senate is currently not in session, and all 100 senators would have to agree to change the schedule, which is highly unlikely.\nConstitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial when Mr Trump leaves office. But Democrats appear confident that the House can impeach Mr Trump and send the articles to the Senate for a trial at a later date.\nOn Sunday, Democratic House whip James Clyburn said the party may not send any articles to the Senate for trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office.\nIt's a new week in Washington DC, but the fallout from Wednesday's tragic events are just beginning.  \nWith only eight days left of Mr Trump's presidency, Democrats are very aware of the disruption an impeachment and a Senate trial would cause to the early days of Mr Biden's administration.\nThat's why there is talk of delaying Mr Trump's Senate trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office. \nAt that point, the pressure to remove Mr Trump will be past, but other punishments - stripping him of the accommodations and privileges ex-presidents enjoy and prohibiting him from future federal office - still apply.\nA year ago, Senate Republicans voted as a block to acquit the president of impeachment charges. This time, however, there may be some willing to side with Democrats to make sure that Trump, once out of power, never returns again."},

There were 112 positive cases at the 66 EFL clubs in its most recent round of testing. \nThe Football Association will be reminding everyone of their responsibilities.\nIt is understood there are no plans to halt elite sport but government ministers are concerned that the images from dressing rooms could make it harder to defend its continuation. \nA Whitehall source confirmed to the BBC that the celebrations at Chorley and Crawley Town had been noted by ministers, who last week warned football's authorities they had to do all they could to justify elite sport carrying on.\nIn his letter written to clubs on Monday, seen by BBC Sport, EFL chief executive Birch also said: \"Throughout the pandemic, football has provided a glimmer of hope for many millions of people affected by restrictions but we all understand the scrutiny the game remains under.\n\"While football is permitted to continue the actions of all participants will clearly be under the microscope. \n\"I am therefore personally asking you to re-double your efforts, to check, amend and tighten your protocol accordingly, and ensure that players and staff are left in no doubt as to their responsibilities on matchdays.\"\nProfessor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told BBC Breakfast that allowing team sports to continue was \"a balancing act\".\n\"The balancing act is trying to minimise the amount of contact outside very structured environments while trying to keep some semblance of life as will all know it,\" he said.  \n\"It is very much a matter for individuals in their day-to-day life. We have all got to say what, in our own lives, can we do to minimise the amount of impact we have on the NHS and the vulnerable?\"\nElite sport is not quite in the last-chance saloon, but the exemption it has been granted, at a time when grassroots sport has had to stop, cannot be taken for granted. \nA suspension is not yet imminent, but there are also no guarantees, especially if infection rates continue to rise, hospitals become overwhelmed, and the national lockdown has to be strengthened further. The government's patience seems to be wearing thin after the scenes of crowded dressing-room celebrations made a mockery of the social-distancing protocols that clubs were reminded of. \nThe optics of on-field hugs and handshakes, and fans gathering outside grounds, beamed into millions of homes at a time when the government is desperate for the public to stay at home and avoid contact with other households, is highly unhelpful to those making the case for professional sport to be allowed to continue. \nMy understanding is that ministers and medical experts' concerns do not amount to a final warning; they realise that the coverage of elite sport encourages people to stay at home and helps to retain some normality and balance in people's lives, and that protocols have largely been successful in suppressing transmission around training and fixtures. \nBut having warned sports bodies of their responsibilities last week, the government does now expect to see the football authorities in particular redouble their efforts, and for players' behaviour to reflect the privilege they enjoy in being able to continue to work when there has been so much disruption in so many people's work and lives. \nCertainly, football can ill afford any more high-profile breaches of the guidelines by players when away from their clubs.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the rules around celebrations in particular could be \"difficult to understand\".\n\"To control emotions when you are playing at 200mph is very difficult,\" he said on Monday.\n\"We are asking our players at corners, for example, to be man-marking people, pushing people around and not fist-bump anyone.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola voiced similar concerns, saying: \"When one guy scores a goal, I don't know if they can be controlled and not celebrate it.\n\"The joy to celebrate it, I don't know if [a player] is going to think: 'I cannot hug my mate for two, three seconds'.\"\nWolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo described the increase of cases as \"scary\".\n\"What I'm afraid of is the decision to stop - football as we know now will not be the same,\" he said.\n\"This is my biggest fear because the schedule will go crazy.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said: \"Everyone knows the situation and if it gets suspended I don't think it'd be a surprise.\n\"We'll just go with what the Government and Premier League have to say and, if it's the case to carry on, we'll carry on. But I don't think I'm being controversial if I say I don't think anyone would be surprised if we don't carry on with the way it's sweeping through the country.\"\nDespite fans not being allowed to attend matches, football still allows for some sense of escapism - a point Arteta emphasised.\n\"We know what we can bring to society if we are able to do it in safe way,\" he said.\n\"There are a lot of positives to take but it is just that balance. When we are still safe, we can add something positive without this difficult context.\""},

They also allege that Steinmetz forged documents linked to the deal.\nThe BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says Ms Toure has been described as the star witness for the prosecution, but her presence in court is unlikely - she now lives in the United States. She has not yet commented on this trial.\nMr Bonnant told Reuters news agency last month that Steinmetz had \"never paid a cent to Mme Mamadie Toure\" and said she was not married to Lansana Conte. \"She is not a public agent and therefore cannot be corrupted,\" he said.\nDespite its vast natural resources, Guinea remains one of the poorest countries in Africa, and has gained little from the Simandou iron ore riches. \nSteinmetz secured the rights in exchange for an investment of around $160m, but he then sold half of them on to Brazilian multinational mining company, Vale, 18 months later for $2.5bn, netting a massive profit.\nAt the time it was referred to as a \"jackpot\" deal in the financial press. But it also raised questions about why the initial rights were granted so cheaply. \nMo Ibrahim, the Sudanese telecom billionaire and anti-corruption campaigner, asked at the time: \"Are the Guineans who did that deal idiots, or criminals, or both?\"\nSteinmetz has always insisted he did nothing wrong.

{"title": "Why 35 years in power isn't enough for this man", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-55550932", "tag": "news", "tag2": "world-africa", "author": "Patience Atuhaire", "article_text": "\nYoweri Museveni, who came to power on the back of an armed uprising in 1986, has defied the political laws of gravity which have felled other long-serving leaders in the region.\nThe 76-year-old's time at the top has been accompanied by a long period of peace and big developmental changes for which many are grateful. But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents.\nDuring the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of him stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\" \nFor this revolutionary the harvest is still not over.\nMy introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out. \nThe piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings.\nIt is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity.\nHe is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure.\nMany young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language).\nBut the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around. \nIn his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the last election, he has been traversing the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets.\nAnd with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni has been keen to show his vitality. Last April, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November. \n\"If your father loves you, he has to empower you. In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern.\nThe economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power.\nOne of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty. \n\"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says.\n\"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent\u2026 he is an Africanist.\"\nNevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005.\nIndeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm.\nJournalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life.\n\"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote.\nBut something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits. \nHe had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age. \nAnd then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building. \nMany saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life.\nIt is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president. \nThe significance of patronage extends right through society.\nIt sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution.\nBut his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years.\n\"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council.\nWhile acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\".\nDespite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority.\nThe judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government. \nWhen judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.\nFor example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. \n\"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple.\nWhen it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment.\nThe media has also had its independence threatened.\nOn the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni. \n\"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala.\nBut outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds.\nBut perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered.\nAs it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents.\nKizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, once Mr Museveni's physician, first ran against him in the 2001 election. He has been detained and prosecuted on numerous charges, including rape and treason, but has never been convicted.\nNow that Bobi Wine, a singer whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is mounting a serious challenge to the president's rule, he has become the latest politician to face the wrath of the men in uniform.\nThe MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped. \nOn the campaign trail for this election, the police have arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups.\nDuring two days of protests in November following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces.\nSticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face.\nThrough his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control. He has also managed to reinvent himself. \nWhereas he was once the political upstart in his early 40s, anyone taking on that role now risks incurring his considerable wrath."},

{"title": "How Mexico is reclaiming spirulina", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20210111-how-mexico-is-reclaiming-spirulina", "tag": "travel", "tag2": "story", "author": "Nicholas DeRenzo", "article_text": "\nIf you've spent any time dining in Mexico City recently, you may have noticed spirulina cropping up on menus in everything from the usual smoothies to more traditional dishes such as tortillas and \ntlayudas\n (a crisp tortilla base with refried beans and other toppings). But don't assume this is some symbol of encroaching hipster health food globalisation: in fact, centuries before it was deemed a \"superfood\", the vibrantly coloured cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae) \u2013 which grows primarily in warm alkaline lakes, ponds and rivers in the tropics and subtropics \u2013 was a pre-Hispanic dietary staple.\nThe Mexica \u2013 or Aztecs, as they were later known \u2013 harvested the protein-rich substance from the surface of Lake Texcoco, an expansive body of water in central Mexico that was later largely drained by the Spanish to make way for the construction of Mexico City. Here, the waters exhibited the perfect balance of salinity and alkalinity for spirulina to flourish. The Mexica called the foodstuff \ntecuitlatl\n, a Nahuatl word that roughly translates to \"rock excrement\", though they held it in decidedly higher esteem than its name suggests.\n\"Oral traditions say that the Mexica couriers and runners in ancient Tenochtitlan would eat dried spirulina cakes with corn, tortillas, beans, chillies or mole as fuel for long-distance travel,\" said Denise Vallejo, an indigenous first-generation Xicana chef who runs the vegan Los Angeles pop-up \nAlchemy Organica\n.\nEven without modern science, the Mexica could recognise the nutrient density that has made spirulina such a favourite today. It boasts about 60-70% protein by weight and has essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals, especially iron, manganese and B vitamins, according to the Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements. It's so healthy and relatively easy to grow, in fact, that \nexperts think it could be a potential food source for future Mars colonies\n.\nOf course, to the arriving Spanish conquistadors in the 16th Century, it mostly just looked odd. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo wrote in his 1568 memoir about \"a species of bread made of a kind of mud or slime collected from the surface of the lake, and eaten in that form, and has a similar taste to our cheese.\" And Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan included illustrations of spirulina harvesting in his 16th-Century ethnographic study, the Florentine Codex.\n\"After the Spanish invasion, most of its consumption declined with the draining of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico,\" Vallejo said. \"And many of the Spanish didn't enjoy its 'cheesy' or 'slimy' properties. Knowledge of its consumption was lost for a long time.\"\nThe Western world rediscovered the nutritious ingredient in the 1940s, when a French phycologist (a scientist who studies algae) noticed the Kanembu people along Africa's Lake Chad harvesting spirulina and turning it into sun-dried cakes called \ndih\u00e9\n. But it didn't make its grand return to Mexico until a happy accident in the 1960s, when the owners of Sosa Texcoco \u2013 which produced sodium carbonate and calcium chloride in a large snail-shaped pond on the remnants of Lake Texcoco \u2013 noticed a green substance mucking up the works. They reached out to French researchers, who concluded that it was the same organism that had been nourishing the Kanembu for generations. Rather than try to eradicate the cyanobacteria, Sosa Texcoco recognized its value, encouraged its growth and opened the world's first commercial spirulina company, Spirulina Mexicana.\nWhile Spirulina Mexicana has since closed, a micro-farm on the outskirts of San Miguel de Allende called \nSpirulina Viva\n is continuing the ancient tradition. Since 2010, American expat Katie Kohlstedt and her San Luis Potos\u00ed-born husband, Francisco Portillo, have grown fresh spirulina that probably tastes remarkably similar to what the Mexica harvested centuries ago. \"We're really proud to grow it here,\" she said. \"We didn't have to invent something new or bring something from somewhere else.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\n\u2022 \nMexico's ancient caviar\n\u2022 \nWhere there's no queso in quesadilla\n\u2022 \nMexico City's walking fish\nWhile many people may be familiar with spirulina in its dehydrated powdered form, Spirulina Viva sells the green stuff raw and frozen, which imparts a much more delicate flavour. \"Fresh spirulina should be creamy like a spreadable cheese,\" Kohlstedt said. \"If you closed your eyes, you might think you were eating a cross between an avocado and spinach.\" She noted that if you think of spirulina as fishy or an acquired taste, chances are you've been buying a lesser-quality product \u2013 or even one that uses ground fish bones to provide the phosphorus the spirulina needs to grow.\nKohlstedt and Portillo lead spirulina-growing workshops and have welcomed future farmers from as far away as Australia and Argentina. \"It's gardening combined with chemistry,\" Kohlstedt said of the process. But for many consumers, the finished product still remains a bit of a mystery. \"If I read one more article that said spirulina is grown in the ocean or [that shows] a picture of seaweed, I'm just going to scream,\" she said, with a laugh. \"My other two least favourite words are 'pond scum'. I think that's really offensive actually!\"\nKohlstedt recommends eating spirulina as simply as possible, stirred into warm miso soup or bone broth, blended into a smoothie, spread on bread or mixed into guacamole with extra lime juice, because vitamin C has been shown to help iron absorption. \"You're going to feel like you just ate Popeye's lunch,\" she said.\nIn Mexico City, chefs are getting even more creative with the ingredient. You might find spirulina dusting a tlayuda topped with avocado and \nescamoles \n(ant larvae) at \nBalc\u00f3n del Z\u00f3calo\n; brightening a superfood tortilla at \nCintli Tortilleria\n; adding a verdant punch to the smoothie bowls and cheesecakes at \nVegamo\n; and even spiking cocktails at the pre-Hispanic-inspired \nXam\na\nn Bar\n.\nThere, head bartender Kenneth Rodrigez has incorporated spirulina into a number of drinks, including a gin-based cocktail with Mexican lime and asparagus liqueur. \"I use it when somebody doesn't like egg whites or [in drinks for] vegan people, because spirulina has protein and we can get interesting textures,\" Rodrigez said, \"not to mention the incredible colour and the nutritional components that it provides.\"\u00a0\nHe describes the taste notes as \"green, herbal and \nclorofila \n(chlorophyll),\" and said that \"it can be used to enhance other flavours, because it has lots of minerals, like an alternative for salt.\"\u00a0\nAcross the border in Mexican American communities, using spirulina has meant establishing a direct connection with a pre-Hispanic past. At San Antonio's inventive Mexican restaurant \nMixtli\n, for instance, chefs Rico Torres and Diego Galicia featured spirulina on a special menu inspired by the Spanish conquest, and they participated in a collaborative D\u00eda de los Muertos dinner at New York's \nJames\nBeard House\n, where one of the hors d'oeuvres was a smoked spirulina yogurt with trout roe and radishes.\nAt Alchemy Organica, Vallejo incorporates spirulina powder into a pineapple \nagua fresca\n (a Mexican drink made with water, sugar and pureed fruits, seeds, flowers or grains for flavour) with lime and chia seeds. And she has even used it as \"a natural food colouring and nutritional boost, along with cactus and spinach powders\" to make vibrant green \nmasa\n (dough made with corn that has been nixtamalized, or treated with an alkaline solution), which she turns into colourful tortillas and tamales. \"I also use it as a flavour enhancer for some of my seafood-inspired dishes, as it imparts a flavour much like seaweed,\" she explained.\u00a0\nAnd when one of her cooks began selling fresh spirulina at a farmer's market, Vallejo took to simply scooping spoonfuls into her drinks. \"It gives you energy like you'd expect from a cup of coffee!\" she said.\nIn a sense, these chefs are tapping into something much deeper than simply taste or nutrition. Vallejo, who studies \ncuranderismo \n(folk medicine), said that spirulina is often viewed as a detoxifier to prepare for rituals, spells and \"visionary plant ceremonies\". And Kohlstedt has similarly heard about the ingredient's mystical connections, which draw on the similarities between spirulina's helical shape and our own building blocks as humans: \"Someone told me that the reason it's called 'spirulina' has to do with its spiral form, but that it also has to do with our DNA and how there is something really basic and spiritual about how we relate to plants [and cyanobacteria].\"\n\"So many of the 'superfoods' enjoyed today have a rich history in Mesoamerica: chia, amaranth, cacao, avocado, cactus,\" Vallejo noted. \"I think the current decolonising movement in Xicanx, Central American and other Spanish-speaking communities is helping us to rediscover and remember our ancestral foodways. We get to take back our foods and our plant wisdom.

Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it.\nBluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features.\nRaising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well.\nWi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in. \nConnecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers.\nUsing a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale.\nWorldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, \n.\nSmartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia.\nTaiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step.\nBut some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough.\nAs principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks.\nHe says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems. \n\"I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely.\"\nThere is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability. \n\"Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,\" he says.\nAnother challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi. \n\"Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,\" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks.\n\"The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,\" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly. \nOne solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection.\nIt can also be tricky to install smart locks.\nYale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws. \nHelpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky.\n\"I'm a bit of a door nerd now,\" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks.\nFor fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy. \nOne workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether. \nA server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. \"The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,\" she says. \nLock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens. \nSome want an \"active command and control experience\" using Siri or Alexa. \nBut others long for locks to \"do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,\" he says.\nIf we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in.\nThey can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.\nIf you, or someone you know, are affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) "},

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Atlanta and Feud: Bette and Joan. \nThe Sex Pistols electrified British music and, depending on who you believed, threatened the very fabric of society at the tail end of the 1970s. \nThey may only have survived for two years, but their angry, nihilistic singles and violent performances changed the idea of what rock and roll could be. \nOriginally formed in 1972 by Jones and drummer Paul Cook, they were galvanized by the addition of John Lydon - aka Johnny Rotten - whose abrasive vocals and anti-establishment lyrics defined the band and, to a large extent, the British punk movement.\nThey only released one album, but the sheer sonic force of songs like Anarchy In The UK, God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant became symbols of Britain's social and political turmoil, as youth unemployment soared, with young people particularly affected.\nNot that everyone was impressed by the Sex Pistols' curious combination of anger and apathy. \nTheir singles were blacklisted on the British charts and a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying their album cover. Facing bans across the UK, the group had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. - \"Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly\".\nAlways on the verge of chaos, they finally split up on a US tour in 1978. \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" a tired and disillusioned Johnny Rotten asked the audience at their final show - but their legacy was ensured.\n\"Imagine breaking into the world of The Crown and Downton Abbey with your mates and screaming your songs and your fury at all they represent,\" said Boyle, announcing his new project. \n\"This is the moment that British society and culture changed forever. It is the detonation point for British street culture... where ordinary young people had the stage and vented their fury and their fashion\u2026and everyone had to watch and listen\".\nThe series is based on Steve Jones's memoir, Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol; which doesn't just focus on his time with the band.\nIt begins in West London, where the young musician suffered maternal neglect and sexual abuse by a step-father, and quickly fell into crime - including an attempt to climb the chimneys of Battersea Power Station, and stealing amps from a David Bowie gig.\nAfter becoming entranced by the glam rock scene, he is taken under the wings of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who helped form, style and promote the Sex Pistols.\nThe book demystifies the band behind the myth - showing how they struggled with the criticisms lobbed their way and the pressure of living up to their image, including the moment Jones was goaded into swearing live on primetime TV.\nLater chapters deal with his battles with addiction, and his recent reinvention as a tee-total \"semi-retired sexual deviant who doesn't really act out so much any more\".\nBritish-born, Australian-raised actor Toby Wallace will play Jones, following eye-catching roles in the coming-of-age drama Babyteeth and Netflix drama The Society, where he played evil teen Campbell Elliot.\nAnson Boon, last seen in the Kate Winslet tear-jerker Blackbird takes on the spittle-flecked role of Johnny Rotten; while out-of-control bassist Sid Vicious will be played by Louis Partridge.\nSydney Chandler - daughter of film star Kyle - will become Pretenders star Chrissie Hynde, who had an affair with Jones at the height of the Sex Pistols' fame.\nThe Witcher's Emma Appleton is cast as Nancy Spungen, the American girlfriend of Sid Vicious, who died in mysterious circumstances in October 1978.\nAnd Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams plays \"the face of punk\", the iconoclastic model and actress Pamela Rooke, whose signature style - ripped fishnets, dominatrix heels and raccoon-like eye make-up - defined the scene.\nThe Sex Pistols project isn't the only musical series in the pipeline.

The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals.\nPCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment.\nA series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity.\nThe chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea.\nPCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises.\nOne killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded.\nAlthough levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely.\nPCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life. \nA recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a \"cocktail of pollutants\", which are passed down from mother to calf.\nScientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain.\nIn humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality.\nStrandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast.\nThe deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections.\nIn the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades.\nThe study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility.\n\"Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,\" said Rosie Williams.\nPopulations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility.\n\"This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,\" she said.\n\"That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals.\"\nThere are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber.\nThe study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.\nFollow Helen on \n."},

I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual.\nBut then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read. \nWith a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now.\nParler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too.\nTechnology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons.\n\"Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,\" she said.\nIt's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too.\nAgain, this is not unheard of. \nGab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days.\nWhat is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president.\nSince Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch.\nYouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance.\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as \"problematic\".\nEU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as \"the 9/11 moment of social media\", \n that \"the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing\".\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now \"taking editorial decisions\", adding that platforms were \"choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice\".\nElsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship.\nHe tweeted: \"The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship.\"\nThe fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter.\nOne of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse.\nPlatforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies.\nBut since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders.\nIn March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation.\nIt wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence.\nThe president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\".\nSocial media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets \"a pivotal precedent\" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post.\nSome analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide.\nOn Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election.\nPrivacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants. \n\"Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world.

On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021.\nBBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch.\nThe fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation.\nA recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground.\nVaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than\nfirst doses had been administered. \nBut some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses.\nMuch of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order.\nGermany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. \nMr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand.\nGermany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer.\nThe Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager.\nBut the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. \"We believed when we contributed \u20ac12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,\" he told a newspaper this week.\nThe country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to \n people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. \nIt has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature.\nHowever, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer.\nFrance's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to \n - still so small as to be statistically meaningless.  \nSo why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used.\nThe primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. \nEach recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives.\nAnother problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers.\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings.\nPolitically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a \"state scandal\", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free.\nRussia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity.\nSputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded.\nA poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week that \n had been vaccinated.\nBut one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown.\nRussia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped.\nAlmost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is still \nof how many others have received the vaccination. \nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains \"feasible\". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. \nAlongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February.\nSwedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine.\nA successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. \nMeanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands.\nIt seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further \nelderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial.\nThe mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be \"seamless and fast\", tweeting: \"If that does not work, shoot me.\"\nThe first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September.\nYou may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed.\nAfter getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its \"careful\" approach.\nAnd there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. \nIn a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least.\nSpain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with \npeople vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. \nEach of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. \nGovernment data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. \nAlthough vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination.\nHowever, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. \nThe arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by \"political affiliations or parliamentary needs\", a claim the central government has rejected.

But it says the design has \"great potential\".\nOne day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet.\nIn traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky.\nUnder a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload.\nMaveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\"There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,\" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant.\n\"We believe that we have to go into a really\u2026 breakthrough technology,\" she says.\nAn equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.\nResearchers there are working on a design known as the \"Flying-V\". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350.\nLike Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves.\nThe designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be \"plugged\" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once.\n\"We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,\" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology.\nThe design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany.\nThe flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success.\nResearchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as \"Dutch roll\". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as \"a somewhat rough landing\" that damaged the front landing gear.\nData from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator.\nAirlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V.\nThe attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact.\nBut with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as \"showstoppers\".\nAmong them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency.\nThere's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the \"wing\" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal.\nBuilding a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region.\n\"That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,\" says Mr Wright.\nAirbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer.\nIts rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing.\nAircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier.\nBoeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design.\nBut current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at \n - are based on proving that concept.\nFor longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power.\nOne major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane.\nBut the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities.\nThose priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion.\nAirbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power.\nIn September, Airbus \n.\nHydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing.\nBut there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide.\nIn order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution.\n\"Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,\" he explains."},

For nearly five years, she willingly paid the city's premium rents and taxes, while commuting to work in another state.\nBut the pandemic wore her down.\n\"I was like, 'The city's going to come back. By July, it's going to be ok.' But it just kept not being ok,\" she says.\n\"I wasn't planning on leaving at all,\" she adds. \"It was a complete switch.\"\nSince March, property firms and moving companies have reported a rush of demand from people leaving New York, many of them young families, as the pandemic drives demand for bigger homes and more outdoor space, while making relocation easier by expanding remote work.\nAnd so far, the surge hasn't shown signs of slowing, says Liz Nunan, president of property firm Houlihan Lawrence, which handles home sales in suburbs around New York City, and reported its best year on record in 2020.\n\"One of the things I learned in 2020 is that I have no idea what the future holds, but I feel rather bullish on 2021,\" she says. \"I believe we'll have a year that's nearly as strong as 2020 turned out to be.\"\nLast year, longer distance relocations from New York City helped push New York the state to the biggest population decline of any in the US, putting it on track for its first population fall of any decade since the 1970s. \nThe signs of outflow have spawned a small universe of articles debating whether New York City is dead or dying, and what - if anything - should be done to help it recover. \nAnd as the US confronts an economic crisis likely to outlast the pandemic that precipitated it, such concerns are not unique to the US's largest city.\nSmaller downtowns across the country have watched in despair as signs of long-sought revival - new restaurants, businesses in formerly abandoned buildings - disappear almost overnight.\n\"This is a difficult time for everybody,\" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank. \"The real issue is: can these cities hold their economic vitality?\" \nIn New York, the pandemic has closed theatres, emptied offices, halted tourism, and turned shopping and dining into hazards to be undertaken at your own risk, gutting industries that employed a fifth of the city's workforce.\nAs many as a third of the city's small businesses may not survive the pandemic, according to estimates by local business group, the Partnership for New York City. Most companies in the city's downtown do not expect staff to ever return to the office in full force. Some firms have already left.\nThe situation has \n - almost double the national average - swollen the ranks of the homeless, and helped spur the departure of more than 300,000 people like Andrea, further straining public finances.\nIn response, New York leaders have raised the prospect of increasing taxes and cutting services like transportation, garbage collection and park maintenance, while begging for emergency aid from Washington to resolve financial woes - pleas that so far have fallen on deaf ears.\nMichael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at the free market Manhattan Institute think tank, worries the potential cuts will further accelerate the outflow, hurting the very amenities that make city life attractive and leaving a poorer city for those who remain.\n\"It's not really so much the pandemic that is the greatest challenge to New York City,\" he says. \"It's really the second order consequences that have dealt a blow to the city's recovery and its citizens.\n\"New York is not dead, but it is on life support,\" he says. \"Whether its recovery is measured in months or years or decades is primarily determined by the degree of leadership that we see in the city. And I think that's why we should be so concerned.\"\nIn some ways, such worries are uniquely American, reflecting the safety woes and weak educational systems that set so many US cities apart from counterparts in Europe and Canada, says Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto. He predicts that coronavirus outflow from cities outside the US will be less dramatic and more temporary.\nIn the US, however, the urban revival of the early 2000s had shown signs of fading even before the pandemic, as immigration waned and moves to the suburbs accelerated. \nIn New York, the population has been falling since 2016.\nThe expansion of remote work caused by the pandemic means the city is now competing with even more places for businesses and families - trends that are unlikely to fully reverse even after life returns to normal, Prof Florida says.\n\"Talented people have choice now with remote work. Those choices will be made carefully,\" he says. \"The big winners are places with a lot of amenity, and the premium for amenity will grow. That means cities with wonderful coast lines or rural areas near mountains. Places like Miami Beach, or Bozeman, Montana, or Aspen, Colorado, or the Hudson Valley of New York.\" \nAndrea, who initially decamped to her mother's home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says she hasn't entirely written off New York. But for now, she's planning a cross-country road trip, working remotely while scoping out new cities to potentially call home.  \n\"I'm going to hop in the car\u2026 and drive around the country, and see if anything feels like a fit,\" she says. \"If it doesn't, then I'll see where the world is in September.\"\nKevin Pearsall and his wife left New York City in March for Atlanta, Georgia. After years of focusing on their careers in advertising, the 35-year-old says they wanted a hometown where they didn't feel like housing and other living costs remained a stretch - even on their healthy six-figure salaries.\nThey both landed jobs as remote workers for New York firms - another sign that convinced them the city was no longer the only place they could combine professional opportunity and social life.\n\"All of the great things about New York - speakeasies, beer gardens... that's not really as unique as it used to be,\" he says.\n\"We were already in motion, thinking about leaving,\" he says. The pandemic \"just accelerated\" the move.\nNew York leaders have expressed confidence that the city will remain a draw, noting that outflow of a few hundred thousand hardly makes a dent in a city of more than eight million. \n\"I'm not going to beg people to stay,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last year. \"I know this city will rebound. I know it. And I know others will come. They have for generations.\" \n\"We can't overrate this moment in history,\" he added. \"It is a passing moment. There will be a vaccine. And then all the strengths of New York City will reassert again.\"\nHow it will shake out in the long term remains a question.\nThe neighbourhoods that emptied during lockdowns last year were the city's wealthiest, but a Manhattan Institute survey this summer found that \n with dissatisfaction highest among those with lower incomes.\nMr Hendrix says it is tempting to hope a more affordable city will emerge if the rich depart, but he worries such an exodus will generate still more challenges, given how dependent the city is on high earners for tax revenue.\n\"It doesn't take a majority leaving the city or a majority changing their lifestyle to make a big difference,\" he says.\n is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nProf Florida says the biggest cities, like New York and San Francisco, are likely to remain a draw for young people, who should benefit if rents continue to fall. \nBut he warns that such declines were short-lived after previous crises.

In this image, the oil paintings of political figures in the background emphasise this imagery of the past.\nThere have been renewed calls for the Confederate flag to be banned across the US following the anti-racism protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, a black man.\nHowever Mr Trump has defended use of the flag, calling it a matter of free speech.\nOne man in a Trump beanie here walks between the red guide ropes, as many visitors might do on a guided-tour to view the Crypt, the Statuary Hall and the Rotunda.\nBut this man is carrying a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, as he poses in front of a painting depicting the surrender of Gen Burgoyne in the war of independence. \nAnother man, identified as Jake Angeli, an ardent Trump supporter who has attended a number of the president's rallies, shouts as he makes his way to the Senate Chamber. \nHis incongruous garments set him apart from other protesters wearing black hoodies. These Trump activists stand by taking selfies, but he has clearly come here to be photographed by others.\nThe apparent lack of a security presence is in sharp contrast to other Washington protests where there is a highly visible presence of heavily armed security forces protecting US institutions.\nAnother Trump supporter, identified as Richard Barnett, sits with one boot disrespectfully on a desk that is at the very centre of power in Congress. It is in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \nIn the scene, unimaginable days earlier, Barnett in his baseball cap and checked shirt resembles a raconteur regaling friends with tales of his exploits. \nThe image went viral as did pictures of the notes he and others left on Ms Pelosi's desk.\nThis dramatic image shows how the formal proceedings came to a violent halt as Capitol police officers drew their guns on doors being attacked by protesters intent on entering the House Chamber.\nMany commentators asked if they were watching a coup unfold as doors were barricaded and firearms brandished.\nThe composition is reminiscent of a scene in a Hollywood Western, the lawmen bracing for the doors to be breached.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden made an impassioned TV address describing the scenes as \"an assault on democracy\" - this chilling picture encapsulates what he meant.

Mr Wolf last week called on Mr Trump to \"strongly condemn\" the protesters who stormed Congress.\nThe outgoing secretary said his departure had been prompted by \"recent events\", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment.\nLaw enforcement around the country are said to be bracing for the possibility of further violence in the days before Joe Biden takes office. \nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.   \n around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. \nCalls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots.\nLocal police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses following last week's violence, according to US media. \nThe Reuters news agency, citing a federal law enforcement official, said the FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration. \nAlthough the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were reported elsewhere in the country at the same time.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday that it would begin National Special Security Event (NSSE) operations for the inauguration six days early, starting Wednesday.\nThe designation allows a wide range of security and law enforcement agencies to coordinate together on special protective measures, like enforcing road closures and a secure perimeter.\nThe announcement came after Washington DC's Mayor, Ms Bowser, went public with her appeal to bolster security after what she described as an \"unprecedented terrorist attack\" at the US Capitol last week.\nShe has also asked Americans to avoid travel to Washington DC for the event. Inaugurations traditionally draw hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital, but the coronavirus pandemic had already curtailed those plans before security fears were heightened. \nThe Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, said Monday that 10,000 troops will be in Washington DC by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested by local officials.\nElsewhere, the National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid \"credible threats\" of further violence.  \n\"Groups involved in the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol continue to threaten to disrupt the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20,\" the service said in a statement, adding it could institute further temporary closures to other areas within the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \nSpeaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was \"not afraid\" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears.\nHis inauguration committee has announced that the ceremony will be themed around \"America United\". \nAfter being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. \nDonald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years not to do so.\nThe warnings about further pro-Trump violence come as efforts move forward to impeach the president for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol.\nAn article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" during a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was \"stolen\" from him. \nDemocrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office.\nMr Trump has made no public statements since \n - on Friday.\nIt comes as websites and social media networks crackdown against other users and websites seen to be encouraging violence - including social network Parler, \n.

The 76-year-old faces 10 challengers, most notably the pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine. \nHuman rights groups have accused security forces of using excessive force to break up opposition rallies during the campaign. But the government says the strong measures are necessary to ensure people comply with a ban on large crowds imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nHere are the five things you need to know about the crucial vote:\nPresident Museveni is one of the longest-serving presidents in Africa. He and his National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986 at the end of a five-year war, and have led Uganda ever since.\nHis supporters praise him for bringing relative peace and prosperity to the country, and in particular for his policies on health. He helped limit the spread of HIV, and more recently his harsh lockdown - which closed schools and business, banned vehicle movement and imposed mandatory public mask use in May - is credited with tackling the coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to Johns Hopkins University, \n and around just 300 deaths from the illness.\nBut while he was once hailed in the West as one of the new generation of African leaders, his critics accuse him of turning into another authoritarian leader. \nMr Museveni has no designated successor within his party, and in 2017 \n allowing him to run again for the presidency. \nHe has seen off a number of challengers to his rule over the years, notably long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was arrested numerous times and decided not to run again for the presidency in 2021. \nWhile Mr Museveni maintains a large support base, especially in rural areas, he is facing increasing opposition over rising inequality and his rigid control over the country.\nOne of 10 candidates challenging him for the presidency this year is musician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known by the stage name Bobi Wine. \nAffectionately referred to as the \"ghetto president\", the 38-year-old became an East African musical superstar in the early 2000s before switching to politics and winning a seat in parliament in 2017.\nBobi Wine is seen as the biggest challenge to Mr Museveni's rule and has mobilised many young people who have not previously been involved in politics. He has sharply criticised the president in the past and accused him of \"fearing the people\".\nThe president has not taken this challenge lightly. He has accused Bobi Wine of being a foreign agent of those \"who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda\" and said that opposition figures are misleading young people to get involved in violence on the campaign trail. \nBobi Wine has been arrested several times since he became involved in politics. He has spoken of a \"revolution\" against Mr Museveni. \n using the hashtag \"WeAreRemovingADictator\".\nPart of Bobi Wine's popularity comes down to his age. At 38, he is just half as old as President Museveni, in one of the youngest nations on earth. \n Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide, of just 15.7 - only Niger is younger. \nThe \"ghetto president\" grew up in a slum in the capital, Kampala. His background and his efforts to promote social justice in his country through his music and as a politician have endeared him to this younger, more urban generation. \nBut Bobi Wine has also surprised authorities by drawing big crowds of supporters in rural areas - thought to be a bastion of support for President Museveni.\nTensions are high, and the campaign has been marred by serious violence, which has left dozens killed and hundreds more arrested. \nOfficials have cited measures brought in to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic for their efforts to break up political gatherings. But \n that security forces are using these regulations \"as a pretext to violate rights and clamp down on the opposition and the media\". \n for allegedly breaching Covid measures. His detention sparked protest which led to a wave of arrests and left dozens dead, mostly allegedly shot by the security forces.\nAfterwards, \n and said \"police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence\".\n\"Can I repeat? Police have a right to shoot you and you die for nothing.... do it at your own risk.\"\nBobi Wine has since taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest and helmet on the campaign trail. \nAt the end of last year he halted his campaign after a number of his team were injured as security forces dispersed one of his political rallies. He later told broadcaster CNN he had survived several assassination attempts. \nA country of more than 42 million people, Uganda is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nIt has one of the highest refugee populations worldwide, hosting \n from neighbouring countries. \nSome are watching the political unrest in the country with concern, and worry about what could happen after the vote. There has never been a peaceful transfer of power in Uganda and it is not clear what would happen if Mr Museveni were to lose, and what the military would do.\nThe president announced a shake-up of the armed forces in November, bringing in the former head of Uganda's operations in Somalia, Maj Gen Paul Lokech, as deputy inspector general of police to coordinate security forces around the capital during the election period. \nThe European Union has chosen not to send observers to the election this year - reportedly because \n to make polling more fair - meaning there will be less international scrutiny.

The opposition says this is because it is popular in those areas, but the government says the measure is due to Covid-19 restrictions. \n\"We found this network to be linked to the government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda,\" Facebook said in a statement. \n\"They used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were,\" the statement continued. \nBut government spokesman Ofwono Opondo hit back in a \n, accusing Facebook of failing to adhere to \"natural justice\" and echoing suggestions by other government figures that the social network is trying to influence the election outcome. \n\"We are not familiar with anybody who complains about these accounts,\" he said. \"The owners have not received any notice and no-one was asked to make any response to the allegations.\"\nMr Opondo described Facebook as high-handed. \"I think they are playing the usual games,\" he added. \"We know that they have a side in this election perhaps.\" \nThe government spokesman said Thursday's elections would be free and fair.\nThe BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that the campaign period has been dominated by social media, as political parties moved to reach a young, politically aware population.\nMany new accounts promoting messages from both the ruling party and the opposition have popped up in the last couple of months, especially on Facebook and Twitter. In many cases, the users did not use proper names, and shared content filled with hate messages and fake news, she says. \nUgandans online have said saying that the government has finally got a taste of what it feels like to be censured.\nIn December, the Uganda Communications Commission, the media industry regulator, wrote to Google, asking it to shut down several YouTube channels associated with Bobi Wine.\nIn the past, the government body has ordered online content creators such as influencers and bloggers to register and have their material vetted before publication, but this was put on hold after it was challenged in court. \nDuring the 2016 election, the government blocked social media on polling day and for several after, which led to the proliferation of VPN use in the country.\nIt feels like there is a fresh wind blowing through social media in terms of how it deals with political content.\nFirst we saw US President Donald Trump banned from Twitter and Facebook and now that has been extended beyond the US to Africa. \nFacebook has shut a slew of accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials, accusing them of \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\" in the public debate ahead of Thursday's election.\nMark Zuckerberg has long insisted that the platform he founded has to allow all forms of free speech and cannot become an arbiter of political conversations.\nSo what has changed? The truth is that the platform has increasingly focused on misinformation in recent years but the violence and chaos witnessed at the heart of the US government in recent days have forced it to speed up these attempts, and make some pretty big decisions.\nThe days of describing itself as a mere conduit for content seem to be well and truly over.\nIt has tried lots of ways to reduce misinformation, including ranking reliable journalism higher than fake news and training algorithms to identify \"bad\" posts, but it has had mixed results.\nBut now with all eyes on it, it is going to have to find a way to deal with content in a way that pleases politicians, its users and its advertisers, who do not want to be associated with a platform that is being accused of inciting unrest or influencing the results of elections.\nIt remains unclear how it will do so in the long term but in the short term expect more knee-jerk reactions to political events around the world.\nAnd the new look for the social network will come at a price.\nSome Ugandan officials are already accusing it of meddling in its election. Facebook could be stuck between a rock and a hard place for some time to come."},

So I lowered the prices, as it was more important to protect people than to think of profit,\" the 35-year-old tells the BBC.\n\"I had to increase my production by 75% to meet the demand when the pandemic started, so Covid-19 has been good for my business.\n\"But I made sure I gave free soap to vulnerable people such as the elderly and the disabled.\"\nMr Havyarimana's initiative has been praised by the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, which often highlights the contribution of refugee entrepreneurs to their host communities.\n\"The refugees are playing a pivotal role in helping contain the spread of Covid-19 in Kakuma,\" Eujin Byun, a spokesperson for UNHCR in Kenya tells the BBC.\n\"They helped in many ways, from disseminating information about the virus to helping people take the necessary measures.\"\nShe added that she was not surprised by Mr Havyarimana's decision to lower prices.\n\"Refugees are very community-oriented and they will look after each other. They have previously stepped up and helped us do our jobs in situations like that.\"\nMr Havyarimana currently employs 42 people in his business, named Glap Industries - short for God Loves All People. The bulk of the workers are refugees but 18 are Kenyans from the town of Kakuma.\nGlap supplies local businesses and institutions outside the camp and even relief agencies.\n\"The agencies buy my soaps to give away to refugees who cannot afford them and for their own staff too,\" the Burundian proudly notes. \nMr Havyarimana is not the only local soap merchant, but he does not fear the competition, and in fact offers classes to teach people how to make cleaning products.\n\"I want to mentor women and younger people so they can have an opportunity to become self-reliant and improve their lives like I did,\" he says.\n\"I want to help the community in any way I can.\" \nEfforts like his may have helped keep Covid-19 at bay in Kakuma. \nThe most recent UNHCR figures, dating from 24 December, show that there had been 341 confirmed cases with 19 people under medical care. There have been 10 deaths from the virus.\nKenya has registered nearly 100,000 cases nationally, with around 1,700 deaths, health ministry figures show.\nPolitical instability and violence have forced more than 300,000 people to flee Burundi to neighbouring African countries in the last decade, according to the UNHCR.\nMr Havyarimana was in the middle of his chemistry studies at the University of Burundi when he left. He says his life was in danger and that he was receiving death threats from relatives of his late mother, who also seized his home.\nAfter arriving in Kakuma, he wanted to make money for himself, rather than relying on humanitarian aid.\nThe camp sits in an isolated and arid region where the provision of basic services is a challenge for relief agencies. \nExploring the region, Mr Havyarimana noticed there was not a soap factory, which meant that cleaning products had to be brought from elsewhere.\n\"I had no idea of how to make soap, so I started surfing the web for some knowledge,\" he explains.\nHe later enrolled in a soap-making course offered by the World Lutheran Federation aid agency, and with a loan from a former classmate in Burundi, he started the business alongside two helpers.\nHe also received grants from relief agencies including the UNHCR and NGOs such as the African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC), which says it has supported more then 18,000 refugee entrepreneurs.\n\"Innocent's story shows how refugees can contribute to their host communities in a number of ways,\" Julienne Oyler, the AEC's chair, tells the BBC.\n\"Camps like Kakuma are so isolated that entrepreneurs like him are a lifeline to basic goods and services at a time of lockdowns and other restrictions.\"\nA 2018 World Bank study identified over 2,000 businesses in Kakuma and estimated that they contributed more than $50m (\u00a337m) to the local economy every year.\nMichelle Richey, a lecturer in technology and entrepreneurship at the UK's Loughborough University specialising in refugee business ventures, says people like Mr Havyarimana are very import in changing the general perception of refugees.\n\"The human potential within refugees shows when we give them chances to work instead of just focusing on humanitarian issues,\" she says.\n\"We can help those people have some control of their lives again after all they have been through.\"\nStarting a thriving business is not the only change in Mr Havyarimana's life since arriving in Kakuma. In 2017, he married Aline, a fellow Burundian refugee he met at the camp. \nThey have two sons, and the youngest one, Prince, was born in late November. \nMr Havyarimana speaks with fondness about life in Kenya but he dreams of being resettled in Australia or Canada. \n\"I like Kakuma a lot, but I want to give my wife and kids a better life,\" he says.\nIn the meantime, Mr Havyarimana is focusing on expanding his ways to help the community, and as well as offering 21 kinds of soap and cleaning products, he has devised a hand sanitiser created from aloe vera grown in a patch just outside his workshop.\n\"Coronavirus has affected the whole world but for us here in Kakuma, it has made it even more important that we clean our hands in any we can,\" he says."},

Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony.\nThis is the second time Democrats have pursued impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nIn December 2019, the House impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020.\nNo US president has ever been impeached twice.\nHowever, the prospect of an impeachment conviction is unlikely because of Mr Trump's broad Republican support in the Senate.\nThe resolution drafted by three Democrats - who began writing it while under lockdown in the Capitol last Wednesday - consists of one article: \"Incitement of insurrection\".\n\"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,\" the resolution reads.\nIn the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in \"imminent lawless action at the Capitol\".\nThe resolution also says this was \"consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct\" the certification of President-elect Biden's election win.\n\"He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,\" the resolution says.\nImpeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial.\nArticles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial to decide whether to convict or not. There is no appeal against outcome.\nAn impeachment is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nMr Trump was the third US president to be impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were also left in office by the Senate.\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached in 1974, as political pressure built over the Watergate scandal.\nOn Monday, the Democrats presented a resolution to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president and the cabinet to declare Mr Trump unfit for office.\nThe resolution urged Mr Pence to \"declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the president is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office\".\nBut, as expected, the resolution was not adopted by unanimous consent in the House, after Republican Alex Mooney of West Virginia objected to the request.\nThe House has now gone into recess until Tuesday morning, when the chamber is expected to vote on the resolution.\nAfter the vote, the Democrats said they will give Mr Pence 24 hours to remove Mr Trump from office before they move toward impeachment.\n\"The president's threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,\" Speaker Pelosi said.\nAlthough Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment.\nImpeachments are usually long, drawn-out affairs, involving investigations and hearings that can take weeks to conclude. This impeachment is expected to be much quicker. \nMonday's presentation of the impeachment article to the House paves the way for a vote to be held. A simple majority in favour of impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Senate.\nHowever, an internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires.\nThe Senate is currently not in session, and all 100 senators would have to agree to change the schedule, which is highly unlikely.\nConstitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial when Mr Trump leaves office. But Democrats appear confident that the House can impeach Mr Trump and send the articles to the Senate for a trial at a later date.\nOn Sunday, Democratic House whip James Clyburn said the party may not send any articles to the Senate for trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office.\nIt's a new week in Washington DC, but the fallout from Wednesday's tragic events are just beginning.  \nWith only eight days left of Mr Trump's presidency, Democrats are very aware of the disruption an impeachment and a Senate trial would cause to the early days of Mr Biden's administration.\nThat's why there is talk of delaying Mr Trump's Senate trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office. \nAt that point, the pressure to remove Mr Trump will be past, but other punishments - stripping him of the accommodations and privileges ex-presidents enjoy and prohibiting him from future federal office - still apply.\nA year ago, Senate Republicans voted as a block to acquit the president of impeachment charges. This time, however, there may be some willing to side with Democrats to make sure that Trump, once out of power, never returns again."},

There were 112 positive cases at the 66 EFL clubs in its most recent round of testing. \nThe Football Association will be reminding everyone of their responsibilities.\nIt is understood there are no plans to halt elite sport but government ministers are concerned that the images from dressing rooms could make it harder to defend its continuation. \nA Whitehall source confirmed to the BBC that the celebrations at Chorley and Crawley Town had been noted by ministers, who last week warned football's authorities they had to do all they could to justify elite sport carrying on.\nIn his letter written to clubs on Monday, seen by BBC Sport, EFL chief executive Birch also said: \"Throughout the pandemic, football has provided a glimmer of hope for many millions of people affected by restrictions but we all understand the scrutiny the game remains under.\n\"While football is permitted to continue the actions of all participants will clearly be under the microscope. \n\"I am therefore personally asking you to re-double your efforts, to check, amend and tighten your protocol accordingly, and ensure that players and staff are left in no doubt as to their responsibilities on matchdays.\"\nProfessor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told BBC Breakfast that allowing team sports to continue was \"a balancing act\".\n\"The balancing act is trying to minimise the amount of contact outside very structured environments while trying to keep some semblance of life as will all know it,\" he said.  \n\"It is very much a matter for individuals in their day-to-day life. We have all got to say what, in our own lives, can we do to minimise the amount of impact we have on the NHS and the vulnerable?\"\nElite sport is not quite in the last-chance saloon, but the exemption it has been granted, at a time when grassroots sport has had to stop, cannot be taken for granted. \nA suspension is not yet imminent, but there are also no guarantees, especially if infection rates continue to rise, hospitals become overwhelmed, and the national lockdown has to be strengthened further. The government's patience seems to be wearing thin after the scenes of crowded dressing-room celebrations made a mockery of the social-distancing protocols that clubs were reminded of. \nThe optics of on-field hugs and handshakes, and fans gathering outside grounds, beamed into millions of homes at a time when the government is desperate for the public to stay at home and avoid contact with other households, is highly unhelpful to those making the case for professional sport to be allowed to continue. \nMy understanding is that ministers and medical experts' concerns do not amount to a final warning; they realise that the coverage of elite sport encourages people to stay at home and helps to retain some normality and balance in people's lives, and that protocols have largely been successful in suppressing transmission around training and fixtures. \nBut having warned sports bodies of their responsibilities last week, the government does now expect to see the football authorities in particular redouble their efforts, and for players' behaviour to reflect the privilege they enjoy in being able to continue to work when there has been so much disruption in so many people's work and lives. \nCertainly, football can ill afford any more high-profile breaches of the guidelines by players when away from their clubs.\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the rules around celebrations in particular could be \"difficult to understand\".\n\"To control emotions when you are playing at 200mph is very difficult,\" he said on Monday.\n\"We are asking our players at corners, for example, to be man-marking people, pushing people around and not fist-bump anyone.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola voiced similar concerns, saying: \"When one guy scores a goal, I don't know if they can be controlled and not celebrate it.\n\"The joy to celebrate it, I don't know if [a player] is going to think: 'I cannot hug my mate for two, three seconds'.\"\nWolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo described the increase of cases as \"scary\".\n\"What I'm afraid of is the decision to stop - football as we know now will not be the same,\" he said.\n\"This is my biggest fear because the schedule will go crazy.\"\nSheffield United manager Chris Wilder said: \"Everyone knows the situation and if it gets suspended I don't think it'd be a surprise.\n\"We'll just go with what the Government and Premier League have to say and, if it's the case to carry on, we'll carry on. But I don't think I'm being controversial if I say I don't think anyone would be surprised if we don't carry on with the way it's sweeping through the country.\"\nDespite fans not being allowed to attend matches, football still allows for some sense of escapism - a point Arteta emphasised.\n\"We know what we can bring to society if we are able to do it in safe way,\" he said.\n\"There are a lot of positives to take but it is just that balance. When we are still safe, we can add something positive without this difficult context.\""},

But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents.\nDuring the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of him stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\" \nFor this revolutionary the harvest is still not over.\nMy introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out. \nThe piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings.\nIt is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity.\nHe is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure.\nMany young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language).\nBut the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around. \nIn his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the last election, he has been traversing the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets.\nAnd with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni has been keen to show his vitality. Last April, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November. \n\"If your father loves you, he has to empower you. In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern.\nThe economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power.\nOne of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty. \n\"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says.\n\"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent\u2026 he is an Africanist.\"\nNevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005.\nIndeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm.\nJournalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life.\n\"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote.\nBut something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits. \nHe had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age. \nAnd then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building. \nMany saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life.\nIt is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president. \nThe significance of patronage extends right through society.\nIt sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution.\nBut his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years.\n\"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council.\nWhile acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\".\nDespite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority.\nThe judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government. \nWhen judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.\nFor example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. \n\"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple.\nWhen it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment.\nThe media has also had its independence threatened.\nOn the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni. \n\"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala.\nBut outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds.\nBut perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered.\nAs it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents.\nKizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, once Mr Museveni's physician, first ran against him in the 2001 election. He has been detained and prosecuted on numerous charges, including rape and treason, but has never been convicted.\nNow that Bobi Wine, a singer whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is mounting a serious challenge to the president's rule, he has become the latest politician to face the wrath of the men in uniform.\nThe MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped. \nOn the campaign trail for this election, the police have arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups.\nDuring two days of protests in November following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces.\nSticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face.\nThrough his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control. He has also managed to reinvent himself. \nWhereas he was once the political upstart in his early 40s, anyone taking on that role now risks incurring his considerable wrath."},

{"title": "How Mexico is reclaiming spirulina", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20210111-how-mexico-is-reclaiming-spirulina", "tag": "travel", "tag2": "story", "author": "Nicholas DeRenzo", "article_text": "\nIf you've spent any time dining in Mexico City recently, you may have noticed spirulina cropping up on menus in everything from the usual smoothies to more traditional dishes such as tortillas and \ntlayudas\n (a crisp tortilla base with refried beans and other toppings). But don't assume this is some symbol of encroaching hipster health food globalisation: in fact, centuries before it was deemed a \"superfood\", the vibrantly coloured cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae) \u2013 which grows primarily in warm alkaline lakes, ponds and rivers in the tropics and subtropics \u2013 was a pre-Hispanic dietary staple.\nThe Mexica \u2013 or Aztecs, as they were later known \u2013 harvested the protein-rich substance from the surface of Lake Texcoco, an expansive body of water in central Mexico that was later largely drained by the Spanish to make way for the construction of Mexico City. Here, the waters exhibited the perfect balance of salinity and alkalinity for spirulina to flourish. The Mexica called the foodstuff \ntecuitlatl\n, a Nahuatl word that roughly translates to \"rock excrement\", though they held it in decidedly higher esteem than its name suggests.\n\"Oral traditions say that the Mexica couriers and runners in ancient Tenochtitlan would eat dried spirulina cakes with corn, tortillas, beans, chillies or mole as fuel for long-distance travel,\" said Denise Vallejo, an indigenous first-generation Xicana chef who runs the vegan Los Angeles pop-up \nAlchemy Organica\n.\nEven without modern science, the Mexica could recognise the nutrient density that has made spirulina such a favourite today. It boasts about 60-70% protein by weight and has essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals, especially iron, manganese and B vitamins, according to the Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements. It's so healthy and relatively easy to grow, in fact, that \nexperts think it could be a potential food source for future Mars colonies\n.\nOf course, to the arriving Spanish conquistadors in the 16th Century, it mostly just looked odd. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo wrote in his 1568 memoir about \"a species of bread made of a kind of mud or slime collected from the surface of the lake, and eaten in that form, and has a similar taste to our cheese.\" And Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan included illustrations of spirulina harvesting in his 16th-Century ethnographic study, the Florentine Codex.\n\"After the Spanish invasion, most of its consumption declined with the draining of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico,\" Vallejo said. \"And many of the Spanish didn't enjoy its 'cheesy' or 'slimy' properties. Knowledge of its consumption was lost for a long time.\"\nThe Western world rediscovered the nutritious ingredient in the 1940s, when a French phycologist (a scientist who studies algae) noticed the Kanembu people along Africa's Lake Chad harvesting spirulina and turning it into sun-dried cakes called \ndih\u00e9\n. But it didn't make its grand return to Mexico until a happy accident in the 1960s, when the owners of Sosa Texcoco \u2013 which produced sodium carbonate and calcium chloride in a large snail-shaped pond on the remnants of Lake Texcoco \u2013 noticed a green substance mucking up the works. They reached out to French researchers, who concluded that it was the same organism that had been nourishing the Kanembu for generations. Rather than try to eradicate the cyanobacteria, Sosa Texcoco recognized its value, encouraged its growth and opened the world's first commercial spirulina company, Spirulina Mexicana.\nWhile Spirulina Mexicana has since closed, a micro-farm on the outskirts of San Miguel de Allende called \nSpirulina Viva\n is continuing the ancient tradition. Since 2010, American expat Katie Kohlstedt and her San Luis Potos\u00ed-born husband, Francisco Portillo, have grown fresh spirulina that probably tastes remarkably similar to what the Mexica harvested centuries ago. \"We're really proud to grow it here,\" she said. \"We didn't have to invent something new or bring something from somewhere else.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\n\u2022 \nMexico's ancient caviar\n\u2022 \nWhere there's no queso in quesadilla\n\u2022 \nMexico City's walking fish\nWhile many people may be familiar with spirulina in its dehydrated powdered form, Spirulina Viva sells the green stuff raw and frozen, which imparts a much more delicate flavour. \"Fresh spirulina should be creamy like a spreadable cheese,\" Kohlstedt said. \"If you closed your eyes, you might think you were eating a cross between an avocado and spinach.\" She noted that if you think of spirulina as fishy or an acquired taste, chances are you've been buying a lesser-quality product \u2013 or even one that uses ground fish bones to provide the phosphorus the spirulina needs to grow.\nKohlstedt and Portillo lead spirulina-growing workshops and have welcomed future farmers from as far away as Australia and Argentina. \"It's gardening combined with chemistry,\" Kohlstedt said of the process. But for many consumers, the finished product still remains a bit of a mystery. \"If I read one more article that said spirulina is grown in the ocean or [that shows] a picture of seaweed, I'm just going to scream,\" she said, with a laugh. \"My other two least favourite words are 'pond scum'. I think that's really offensive actually!\"\nKohlstedt recommends eating spirulina as simply as possible, stirred into warm miso soup or bone broth, blended into a smoothie, spread on bread or mixed into guacamole with extra lime juice, because vitamin C has been shown to help iron absorption. \"You're going to feel like you just ate Popeye's lunch,\" she said.\nIn Mexico City, chefs are getting even more creative with the ingredient. You might find spirulina dusting a tlayuda topped with avocado and \nescamoles \n(ant larvae) at \nBalc\u00f3n del Z\u00f3calo\n; brightening a superfood tortilla at \nCintli Tortilleria\n; adding a verdant punch to the smoothie bowls and cheesecakes at \nVegamo\n; and even spiking cocktails at the pre-Hispanic-inspired \nXam\na\nn Bar\n.\nThere, head bartender Kenneth Rodrigez has incorporated spirulina into a number of drinks, including a gin-based cocktail with Mexican lime and asparagus liqueur. \"I use it when somebody doesn't like egg whites or [in drinks for] vegan people, because spirulina has protein and we can get interesting textures,\" Rodrigez said, \"not to mention the incredible colour and the nutritional components that it provides.\"\u00a0\nHe describes the taste notes as \"green, herbal and \nclorofila \n(chlorophyll),\" and said that \"it can be used to enhance other flavours, because it has lots of minerals, like an alternative for salt.\"\u00a0\nAcross the border in Mexican American communities, using spirulina has meant establishing a direct connection with a pre-Hispanic past. At San Antonio's inventive Mexican restaurant \nMixtli\n, for instance, chefs Rico Torres and Diego Galicia featured spirulina on a special menu inspired by the Spanish conquest, and they participated in a collaborative D\u00eda de los Muertos dinner at New York's \nJames\nBeard House\n, where one of the hors d'oeuvres was a smoked spirulina yogurt with trout roe and radishes.\nAt Alchemy Organica, Vallejo incorporates spirulina powder into a pineapple \nagua fresca\n (a Mexican drink made with water, sugar and pureed fruits, seeds, flowers or grains for flavour) with lime and chia seeds. And she has even used it as \"a natural food colouring and nutritional boost, along with cactus and spinach powders\" to make vibrant green \nmasa\n (dough made with corn that has been nixtamalized, or treated with an alkaline solution), which she turns into colourful tortillas and tamales. \"I also use it as a flavour enhancer for some of my seafood-inspired dishes, as it imparts a flavour much like seaweed,\" she explained.\u00a0\nAnd when one of her cooks began selling fresh spirulina at a farmer's market, Vallejo took to simply scooping spoonfuls into her drinks. \"It gives you energy like you'd expect from a cup of coffee!\" she said.\nIn a sense, these chefs are tapping into something much deeper than simply taste or nutrition. Vallejo, who studies \ncuranderismo \n(folk medicine), said that spirulina is often viewed as a detoxifier to prepare for rituals, spells and \"visionary plant ceremonies\". And Kohlstedt has similarly heard about the ingredient's mystical connections, which draw on the similarities between spirulina's helical shape and our own building blocks as humans: \"Someone told me that the reason it's called 'spirulina' has to do with its spiral form, but that it also has to do with our DNA and how there is something really basic and spiritual about how we relate to plants [and cyanobacteria].\"\n\"So many of the 'superfoods' enjoyed today have a rich history in Mesoamerica: chia, amaranth, cacao, avocado, cactus,\" Vallejo noted. \"I think the current decolonising movement in Xicanx, Central American and other Spanish-speaking communities is helping us to rediscover and remember our ancestral foodways. We get to take back our foods and our plant wisdom.

It premiered on HBO in 1998 and ran for six seasons until 2004.\nThe show inspired two films, Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010.

Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it.\nBluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features.\nRaising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well.\nWi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in. \nConnecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers.\nUsing a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale.\nWorldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, \n.\nSmartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia.\nTaiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step.\nBut some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough.\nAs principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks.\nHe says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems. \n\"I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely.\"\nThere is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability. \n\"Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,\" he says.\nAnother challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi. \n\"Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,\" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks.\n\"The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,\" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly. \nOne solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection.\nIt can also be tricky to install smart locks.\nYale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws. \nHelpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky.\n\"I'm a bit of a door nerd now,\" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks.\nFor fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy. \nOne workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether. \nA server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. \"The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,\" she says. \nLock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens. \nSome want an \"active command and control experience\" using Siri or Alexa. \nBut others long for locks to \"do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,\" he says.\nIf we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in.\nThey can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.\nIf you, or someone you know, are affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) "},

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Atlanta and Feud: Bette and Joan. \nThe Sex Pistols electrified British music and, depending on who you believed, threatened the very fabric of society at the tail end of the 1970s. \nThey may only have survived for two years, but their angry, nihilistic singles and violent performances changed the idea of what rock and roll could be. \nOriginally formed in 1972 by Jones and drummer Paul Cook, they were galvanized by the addition of John Lydon - aka Johnny Rotten - whose abrasive vocals and anti-establishment lyrics defined the band and, to a large extent, the British punk movement.\nThey only released one album, but the sheer sonic force of songs like Anarchy In The UK, God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant became symbols of Britain's social and political turmoil, as youth unemployment soared, with young people particularly affected.\nNot that everyone was impressed by the Sex Pistols' curious combination of anger and apathy. \nTheir singles were blacklisted on the British charts and a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying their album cover. Facing bans across the UK, the group had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. - \"Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly\".\nAlways on the verge of chaos, they finally split up on a US tour in 1978. \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" a tired and disillusioned Johnny Rotten asked the audience at their final show - but their legacy was ensured.\n\"Imagine breaking into the world of The Crown and Downton Abbey with your mates and screaming your songs and your fury at all they represent,\" said Boyle, announcing his new project. \n\"This is the moment that British society and culture changed forever. It is the detonation point for British street culture... where ordinary young people had the stage and vented their fury and their fashion\u2026and everyone had to watch and listen\".\nThe series is based on Steve Jones's memoir, Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol; which doesn't just focus on his time with the band.\nIt begins in West London, where the young musician suffered maternal neglect and sexual abuse by a step-father, and quickly fell into crime - including an attempt to climb the chimneys of Battersea Power Station, and stealing amps from a David Bowie gig.\nAfter becoming entranced by the glam rock scene, he is taken under the wings of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who helped form, style and promote the Sex Pistols.\nThe book demystifies the band behind the myth - showing how they struggled with the criticisms lobbed their way and the pressure of living up to their image, including the moment Jones was goaded into swearing live on primetime TV.\nLater chapters deal with his battles with addiction, and his recent reinvention as a tee-total \"semi-retired sexual deviant who doesn't really act out so much any more\".\nBritish-born, Australian-raised actor Toby Wallace will play Jones, following eye-catching roles in the coming-of-age drama Babyteeth and Netflix drama The Society, where he played evil teen Campbell Elliot.\nAnson Boon, last seen in the Kate Winslet tear-jerker Blackbird takes on the spittle-flecked role of Johnny Rotten; while out-of-control bassist Sid Vicious will be played by Louis Partridge.\nSydney Chandler - daughter of film star Kyle - will become Pretenders star Chrissie Hynde, who had an affair with Jones at the height of the Sex Pistols' fame.\nThe Witcher's Emma Appleton is cast as Nancy Spungen, the American girlfriend of Sid Vicious, who died in mysterious circumstances in October 1978.\nAnd Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams plays \"the face of punk\", the iconoclastic model and actress Pamela Rooke, whose signature style - ripped fishnets, dominatrix heels and raccoon-like eye make-up - defined the scene.\nThe Sex Pistols project isn't the only musical series in the pipeline.

The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals.\nPCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment.\nA series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity.\nThe chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea.\nPCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises.\nOne killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded.\nAlthough levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely.\nPCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life. \nA recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a \"cocktail of pollutants\", which are passed down from mother to calf.\nScientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain.\nIn humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality.\nStrandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast.\nThe deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections.\nIn the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades.\nThe study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility.\n\"Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,\" said Rosie Williams.\nPopulations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility.\n\"This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,\" she said.\n\"That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals.\"\nThere are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber.\nThe study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.\nFollow Helen on \n."},

I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual.\nBut then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read. \nWith a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now.\nParler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too.\nTechnology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons.\n\"Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,\" she said.\nIt's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too.\nAgain, this is not unheard of. \nGab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days.\nAnd as part a crackdown on accounts associated with the attack on Congress, on Monday Twitter announced it has shut down \"more than 70,000 accounts\" linked to the \nWhat is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president.\nSince Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch.\nYouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance.\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as \"problematic\".\nEU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as \"the 9/11 moment of social media\", \n that \"the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing\".\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now \"taking editorial decisions\", adding that platforms were \"choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice\".\nElsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship.\nHe tweeted: \"The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship.\"\nThe fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter.\nOne of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse.\nPlatforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies.\nBut since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders.\nIn March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation.\nIt wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence.\nThe president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\".\nSocial media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets \"a pivotal precedent\" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post.\nSome analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide.\nOn Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election.\nPrivacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants. \n\"Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world. I think the president's removal might be the beginning of a purge for similar behaviour globally.\"\nIn his final hours on Twitter, Mr Trump once again blamed a piece of US legislation called Section 230 for \"banning\" free speech. During his presidency he threatened to repeal the law which makes social networks largely exempt from liability for their users' post.\nMany argue that removing the protection would actually harm free speech as networks would be forced to moderate far more than they currently do.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden has also stated that he would like to repeal the law to increase moderation and reduce the spread of fake news.\nIn the same final tweet Mr Trump said that he has been negotiating with \"various other sites\" and that there would be \"a big announcement soon\".\nIf the events of recent days are anything to go by, Mr Trump and some of his supporters face an uphill struggle against not just lawmakers but tech giants too before they can establish themselves on mainstream social media."},
{"title": "Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55575756", "tag": "news", "tag2": "world-europe", "author": "N/A", "article_text": "\nMember states decide individually who to vaccinate, when and where, but the EU is coordinating strategy and buying vaccines in bulk. On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021.\nBBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch.\nThe fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation.\nA recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground.\nVaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than\nfirst doses had been administered. \nBut some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses.\nMuch of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order.\nGermany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. \nMr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand.\nGermany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer.\nThe Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager.\nBut the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. \"We believed when we contributed \u20ac12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,\" he told a newspaper this week.\nThe country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to \n people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. \nIt has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature.\nHowever, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer.\nFrance's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to \n - still so small as to be statistically meaningless.  \nSo why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used.\nThe primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. \nEach recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives.\nAnother problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers.\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings.\nPolitically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a \"state scandal\", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free.\nRussia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity.\nSputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded.\nA poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week that \n had been vaccinated.\nBut one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown.\nRussia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped.\nAlmost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is still \nof how many others have received the vaccination. \nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains \"feasible\". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. \nAlongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February.\nSwedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine.\nA successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. \nMeanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands.\nIt seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further \nelderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial.\nThe mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be \"seamless and fast\", tweeting: \"If that does not work, shoot me.\"\nThe first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September.\nYou may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed.\nAfter getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its \"careful\" approach.\nAnd there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. \nIn a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least.\nSpain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with \npeople vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. \nEach of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. \nGovernment data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. \nAlthough vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination.\nHowever, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. \nThe arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by \"political affiliations or parliamentary needs\", a claim the central government has rejected.

But it says the design has \"great potential\".\nOne day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet.\nIn traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky.\nUnder a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload.\nMaveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\"There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,\" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant.\n\"We believe that we have to go into a really\u2026 breakthrough technology,\" she says.\nAn equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.\nResearchers there are working on a design known as the \"Flying-V\". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350.\nLike Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves.\nThe designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be \"plugged\" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once.\n\"We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,\" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology.\nThe design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany.\nThe flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success.\nResearchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as \"Dutch roll\". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as \"a somewhat rough landing\" that damaged the front landing gear.\nData from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator.\nAirlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V.\nThe attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact.\nBut with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as \"showstoppers\".\nAmong them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency.\nThere's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the \"wing\" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal.\nBuilding a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region.\n\"That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,\" says Mr Wright.\nAirbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer.\nIts rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing.\nAircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier.\nBoeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design.\nBut current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at \n - are based on proving that concept.\nFor longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power.\nOne major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane.\nBut the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities.\nThose priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion.\nAirbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power.\nIn September, Airbus \n.\nHydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing.\nBut there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide.\nIn order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution.\n\"Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,\" he explains."},

For nearly five years, she willingly paid the city's premium rents and taxes, while commuting to work in another state.\nBut the pandemic wore her down.\n\"I was like, 'The city's going to come back. By July, it's going to be ok.' But it just kept not being ok,\" she says.\n\"I wasn't planning on leaving at all,\" she adds. \"It was a complete switch.\"\nSince March, property firms and moving companies have reported a rush of demand from people leaving New York, many of them young families, as the pandemic drives demand for bigger homes and more outdoor space, while making relocation easier by expanding remote work.\nAnd so far, the surge hasn't shown signs of slowing, says Liz Nunan, president of property firm Houlihan Lawrence, which handles home sales in suburbs around New York City, and reported its best year on record in 2020.\n\"One of the things I learned in 2020 is that I have no idea what the future holds, but I feel rather bullish on 2021,\" she says. \"I believe we'll have a year that's nearly as strong as 2020 turned out to be.\"\nLast year, longer distance relocations from New York City helped push New York the state to the biggest population decline of any in the US, putting it on track for its first population fall of any decade since the 1970s. \nThe signs of outflow have spawned a small universe of articles debating whether New York City is dead or dying, and what - if anything - should be done to help it recover. \nAnd as the US confronts an economic crisis likely to outlast the pandemic that precipitated it, such concerns are not unique to the US's largest city.\nSmaller downtowns across the country have watched in despair as signs of long-sought revival - new restaurants, businesses in formerly abandoned buildings - disappear almost overnight.\n\"This is a difficult time for everybody,\" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank. \"The real issue is: can these cities hold their economic vitality?\" \nIn New York, the pandemic has closed theatres, emptied offices, halted tourism, and turned shopping and dining into hazards to be undertaken at your own risk, gutting industries that employed a fifth of the city's workforce.\nAs many as a third of the city's small businesses may not survive the pandemic, according to estimates by local business group, the Partnership for New York City. Most companies in the city's downtown do not expect staff to ever return to the office in full force. Some firms have already left.\nThe situation has \n - almost double the national average - swollen the ranks of the homeless, and helped spur the departure of more than 300,000 people like Andrea, further straining public finances.\nIn response, New York leaders have raised the prospect of increasing taxes and cutting services like transportation, garbage collection and park maintenance, while begging for emergency aid from Washington to resolve financial woes - pleas that so far have fallen on deaf ears.\nMichael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at the free market Manhattan Institute think tank, worries the potential cuts will further accelerate the outflow, hurting the very amenities that make city life attractive and leaving a poorer city for those who remain.\n\"It's not really so much the pandemic that is the greatest challenge to New York City,\" he says. \"It's really the second order consequences that have dealt a blow to the city's recovery and its citizens.\n\"New York is not dead, but it is on life support,\" he says. \"Whether its recovery is measured in months or years or decades is primarily determined by the degree of leadership that we see in the city. And I think that's why we should be so concerned.\"\nIn some ways, such worries are uniquely American, reflecting the safety woes and weak educational systems that set so many US cities apart from counterparts in Europe and Canada, says Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto. He predicts that coronavirus outflow from cities outside the US will be less dramatic and more temporary.\nIn the US, however, the urban revival of the early 2000s had shown signs of fading even before the pandemic, as immigration waned and moves to the suburbs accelerated. \nIn New York, the population has been falling since 2016.\nThe expansion of remote work caused by the pandemic means the city is now competing with even more places for businesses and families - trends that are unlikely to fully reverse even after life returns to normal, Prof Florida says.\n\"Talented people have choice now with remote work. Those choices will be made carefully,\" he says. \"The big winners are places with a lot of amenity, and the premium for amenity will grow. That means cities with wonderful coast lines or rural areas near mountains. Places like Miami Beach, or Bozeman, Montana, or Aspen, Colorado, or the Hudson Valley of New York.\" \nAndrea, who initially decamped to her mother's home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says she hasn't entirely written off New York. But for now, she's planning a cross-country road trip, working remotely while scoping out new cities to potentially call home.  \n\"I'm going to hop in the car\u2026 and drive around the country, and see if anything feels like a fit,\" she says. \"If it doesn't, then I'll see where the world is in September.\"\nKevin Pearsall and his wife left New York City in March for Atlanta, Georgia. After years of focusing on their careers in advertising, the 35-year-old says they wanted a hometown where they didn't feel like housing and other living costs remained a stretch - even on their healthy six-figure salaries.\nThey both landed jobs as remote workers for New York firms - another sign that convinced them the city was no longer the only place they could combine professional opportunity and social life.\n\"All of the great things about New York - speakeasies, beer gardens... that's not really as unique as it used to be,\" he says.\n\"We were already in motion, thinking about leaving,\" he says. The pandemic \"just accelerated\" the move.\nNew York leaders have expressed confidence that the city will remain a draw, noting that outflow of a few hundred thousand hardly makes a dent in a city of more than eight million. \n\"I'm not going to beg people to stay,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last year. \"I know this city will rebound. I know it. And I know others will come. They have for generations.\" \n\"We can't overrate this moment in history,\" he added. \"It is a passing moment. There will be a vaccine. And then all the strengths of New York City will reassert again.\"\nHow it will shake out in the long term remains a question.\nThe neighbourhoods that emptied during lockdowns last year were the city's wealthiest, but a Manhattan Institute survey this summer found that \n with dissatisfaction highest among those with lower incomes.\nMr Hendrix says it is tempting to hope a more affordable city will emerge if the rich depart, but he worries such an exodus will generate still more challenges, given how dependent the city is on high earners for tax revenue.\n\"It doesn't take a majority leaving the city or a majority changing their lifestyle to make a big difference,\" he says.\n is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nProf Florida says the biggest cities, like New York and San Francisco, are likely to remain a draw for young people, who should benefit if rents continue to fall. \nBut he warns that such declines were short-lived after previous crises. And elsewhere in America, he expects downtown business districts - \n - to face major challenges.\n\"The central business districts - those places which packed and stacked knowledge workers in the vertical towers - they are in for a real reckoning,\" he says.
