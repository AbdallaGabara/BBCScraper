# BBCScraper
Crawls BBC.com and stores the extracted article titles, authors (if available), and text on an Atlas Cluster database.
Only use main.py for launching the scraper (otherwise you'd almost certianly run into an error).
Upon starting main.py You have the option of using only previous crawls or launching a new crawl for updating the database.
Afterwards, you can search the website by entering a keyword of your interest and the application will print relevant articles, their urls, authors, tags, and text.
